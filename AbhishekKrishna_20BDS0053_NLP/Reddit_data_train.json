You can withdraw principal cash (not the growth) penalty and tax free if you ever get super screwed by an emergency. You can also choose to invest in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and a lot more as opposed to a 401k.  Pay into the 401(ks) up to the match - both you and your wife - then both of you max out Roth IRAs in each of your names ($6k each).  After that, contribute left over money to 401(k) and keep working your way up the 401k savings rates until you both max out.  \n\nAlso, you may want to think about diversifying your tax liability.  That's a strategy that's always overlooked.  Think about a traditional 401k and a Roth IRA to help diversify your tax liabilities in the future.  "

Dave Ramsey generally has ludicrously bad investment advice and while being mortgage free is appealing, its not gonna garner you big bucks or a secure retirement. Only time will.  An initial investment of $140k, at a typical market return of 5% with 30 years of investment is $605,000. However, your mortgage will still stay at $X,xxx per month as your salary goes up. Paying an additional month or two on your mortgage each year (if your mortgage is 1200 and you add $100-200 additional each month to the principal, you save like 50k in interest on the loan). \n\nI know this may seem like an easy decision or a cheaper decision, but there is a reason economists say that when you win the lottery, take the whole pot, bc over time you'll make more money despite how much they take out.

Recommendation remains the same, in this case. \n\nPersonally, I hate saving for no reason - no sense squirreling money away for an uncertain future unless I know what I want to do with it. Therefore, I like to back into the number I need to save to make retirement happen. \n\nIf you know what kind of retirement you want to have, figure out roughly how much you will need to support yourselves and when you want your retirement to start. Do it all in today's dollars. For example, I know that my wife and I want to do some traveling, we will want to spoil our grandchildren (assuming we're lucky enough to have them), we will want to go out to eat frequently, and we'll want to do fun stuff in our local area; we also won't have loans, as we're building our lives around paying off our mortgage prior to age-60. All told, we'll probably need around 100% of what we currently make (after taxes and saving) in order to make that happen for the first few years of retirement, but that number will drop to 50% within 8-10 years. Knowing what we will likely need and how long we will likely need it, we can back into our number, and knowing historical market returns, we can figure out what we need to save in order to have ~90% chance of being OK.\n\nI would do a similar exercise if I were you. In my planning, I would assume that VA disability payments are still there but Social Security is not. Any SS you do get will be a bonus. \n\nIf you have access to an HSA, I'd max that puppy out. I assume that your medical needs related to the service will be handled by the VA, but your spouse's needs will not be, and having a healthy savings will protect you both in the future, when medical costs are inevitably higher."

For you, it's only natural that you'll be a little behind that figure since you will have had 37.5% less time in your career. \n\nWhat you should do is look at a retirement calculator and see what you're likely to have at retirement, and then try to imagine what your retirement will look like - will you spend more, the same or less? Think also about your pension. Will you be at your company long enough to qualify for the pension, and if so, what is it likely to look like? How likely is it that the pension will still be there for you in retirement? Depending on the answers to those questions, your pension becomes part of your plan or acts as a bonus (kind of like Social Security for people in their 20s and 30s). \n\nI started saving right out of college, but my income today is 2.5x my income at age-22; when I turn 30 next month, I'll have around 80% of my salary saved. My wife started saving right out of college too, but she didn't get into a career-track kind of job until she was 26. She didn't have a 401k option at her work, and she didn't have the resources to contribute a significant amount to her IRA, until she was 29, so her retirement balance is closer to 50% of her salary (most in a Roth account).

This means that it makes no difference whether you invest money put into your account from the VA (thank you for your service and sacrifice, by the way... I assume $45k is roughly 100% on the scale?) or from your regular income; it's all the same in the end. \n\nLet's say you are married filing jointly and earn $75k as a couple in taxable income. After deductions, you'll fall into the 12% federal tax bracket. If you each contribute $6,000 to your Roth IRA, then you will pay taxes like nothing happened and will pay no taxes when you withdraw the funds in retirement; if you each contribute $6,000 to your traditional IRA, you will pay $1,440 less in taxes this year but will pay the blended rate when you withdraw. It does not matter what you used to fund your IRA or Roth IRA; the tax impact is identical.\n\nWhether you *want* to use Roth vs Traditional is a different conversation. If you have $300k in taxable income today but only plan to withdraw the future equivalent of half of that in retirement, then it makes sense to do Traditional; if you have $75k in taxable income today but plan to withdraw way more than that in retirement, then it makes sense to do Roth. Your VA money comes into play in terms of how much you'll need to withdraw while in retirement. If you expect to need $100k/yr out of pocket to live while in retirement, that means you will need to find $55k in some form or other, since $45k is guaranteed for the rest of your life. $55k can come from a combination of Roth, Traditional, Social Security and taxable means.

When my wife and I were searching for our first home, we made \\~$130k and paid $300/mo in debts (car + student loans). When we started going through pre-approval processes, the first bank we spoke to started talking about pre-approving us for $525,000. There is absolutely, positively, no way that we could afford $525,000 without putting every free penny we own into a damn house, but the bank doesn't care about our ability to do things outside of debt service. The bank only cares that we will literally be capable of servicing the debt.\n\nYou can go out and find a bank that will pre-approve you for a $350,000 home, but that doesn't mean that you should.\n\nYou know nothing about your husband's ex-wife's boyfriend's financial situation, and you should absolutely not be thinking about that person when considering your own financial future.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had a friend whose family was pretty much like mine - middle-class homeowners, living in a low-cost city but in a suburban area of the city. When we were 11 (in 2000), his parents moved them to a McMansion in the suburbs; I didn't really think too much about the actual finances involved there, but I can tell you that the house his parents sold was worth around $190k and the one they moved into was probably worth around $500k. \n\nI was so surprised by how rich he was...we drifted apart, as kids do, especially when they go to different schools, but I came to find out that his parents moved into an apartment in 2007. Why? Because they were \"able to afford\" their huge house by taking an adjustable rate mortgage at 2-ish% interest for the first five years, after which point the rate adjusted to 6-ish%. Their mortgage payment increased by $1,000 a month, and they couldn't refinance into another ARM or a lower fixed-rate mortgage; they couldn't sell their house because they had taken out a second mortgage to finance other parts of their lives and because the house was only worth $450k when their rate adjusted, so the bank foreclosed on their home, and they were left with basically nothing.\n\nSeparately, I have a different friend, whose parents own a home very much like mine growing up - a little bigger and in a nicer area, but pretty comparable. In high school, we were very close, and though I knew his family had a decent amount of money, they came off as very down-to-earth. Since we've graduated high school, we've stayed close. His family is just the same as always, but they've made a few...purchases. First, they bought a townhome downtown, for their mid-twenty-something daughter to live in. The townhome cost about $550k in 2011, when they bought it, and they eventually sold it to their daughter at a substantial discount after she established herself as a working professional. The next year, they were at a beach resort one state over, when they saw a charming house in a highly-desirable area, with a dock. They bought that house too - $950,000, with cash. I had had no idea that they were so fabulously wealthy because they did not \"show off\" - they drove their cars 'til they died, they never had cable TV, etc. \n\nI tell these two stories to drive home the point that people's finances are not as they seem. Your husband's ex-wife's boyfriend could be up to his ears in debt, house poor with the mortgage, and paying nosebleed-level interest rates on thousands of dollars on his credit cards; he could also come from a wealthy family and have a trust fund that paid for the house; he could also have gotten a tremendous price on the home. You just don't know. What you *do* know is that you, yourself, are not currently prepared for the financial burdens of homeownership. \n\nNone of this is to mention the fact that you want to have a baby of your own soon. As a first-time-dad of a nearly-one-year-old, let me just tell you that kids are *expensive*. In the first 11 months of my baby's life, we have spent $3,000 on the baby herself, $4,755 on medical care (having the baby and taking her to the doctor since then), $12,733 on child care, and $1,500 to furnish the nursery (this is obviously one you can really cut down on, but still). All told, our baby has cost us more than $20,000 in her first year on this earth. We were prepared for this, financially, because I do pretty well and my wife got short-term disability through her work, which paid 60% of 5 weeks of maternity leave. \n\nIf you're going to have a baby and if you're the sole reliable earner in the household, you're going to need to figure out how to pay for everything you currently have going on, plus additional costs that come in the first few months of a baby's life, all while you are getting, at best, a fraction of your current paycheck. It is challenging enough when you're renting, where most of your costs are fixed. It's a bigger challenge when you're juggling all of that in a home that you also need to pay to maintain. Our washing machine broke the week after our daughter was born. Our choices to deal were a) pay several hundred dollars to replace it or b) try to manage by lugging ourselves to a laundromat multiple times a week. We chose the former, and we wound up spending around $800 after all was said and done. \n\nFrom the sounds of it, a random, added $1,000 expense would be a substantial setback for you right now. If that's the case, then imagine that kind of setback when your family has lower cash flow (due to maternity leave), higher fixed expenses (due to a fourth member of your family), and a depleted savings (due to a home purchase).\n\nBased on the information you provided, you are looking for reasons to go down a path that will provide you with short-term gratification - showing that you, too, can buy a home if somebody whose financial situation is potentially worse than yours can - while injecting long-term risk about your family's financial solvency.

If you are a company paying a recruiting firm $45/hr, your total cost for one FTE (1,960 hours) is $88,200. If that same company were paying you $35/hr as a full time employee, your salary would translate to $72,800/yr. They'd also pay employer portion of payroll tax ($5,569), 401k match (let's assume they match up to 4% of salary, so $2,912), medical benefits (assume \\~$300/mo or $3,600/yr, other insurance (basic life, AD&amp;D, STD, LTD, EAP; call it $1,000/yr). \n\nWith the above assumptions, you're already up to $85,881, AND you have the added risk of not being able to sever the relationship on a dime. When you pay a firm for resources, you pay a premium because you can tell that firm you don't like the person they gave you, and that person can be replaced nearly instantly, at no direct cost to you. Not the same when you have a permanent employee. Even though most states operate at-will, turnover is still very costly (probably a minimum of $10,000 per employee, and much more if a recruiting firm is involved).\n\nFrom an employee's perspective, there are benefits to becoming a permanent employee as well, and you shouldn't underestimate them. \n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't ask for a certain amount; just recognize that it's not as simple as \"well I'm getting this as a contractor, so I should get this other amount as a FTE\" ... $35 seems pretty reasonable to ask for, as does $38. If you're wanted, then nobody's going to get scared away by a high ask; they'll just offer you something lower and see what you say."

If someone is completely comfortable living a modest life in retirement, then it is entirely reasonable to save less, for a shorter period. \n\nI expect to require 50% of my family's current combined salary in order to have a VERY comfortable retirement. How? Well... 1) Around 25% of our expected balance will be in Roth accounts, meaning we can control our tax exposure such that we will pay around 12-13% instead of our effective 25% rate today (no state/local tax on retirement income since it was already taxed!); 2) We're not going to be saving 10% for retirement in retirement; 3) We do not expect to have a mortgage payment (just taxes and insurance), so that saves 7%; 4) We don't expect to have student loans or auto loans, so that saves another 7%; 5) We don't expect to be putting our income into a short-term savings account for things like major home improvements, so that saves another 9%; 6) While our healthcare costs will likely be higher, our general living costs will be lower (will be pretty great not to pay 8-10% of our income in daycare!). \n\nSince we only need to have 50% of our income replaced, we don't *need* to save the recommended 12-15%, but to be safe we do actually save 14% inclusive of company contributions.\n\nIf we wanted to spend our retirement traveling the world or making serious charitable donations or living a life of comparative luxury, then 50% would be nowhere near enough, but because we don't want that, we don't need to have 75-100% income replacement.

You would get the immediate benefits of tax savings, and you will get the long-term benefits of investment.\n\nWhat you *could* do is pay *all* of your medical bills out of pocket, keep track of the expenses, and then withdraw from your HSA when you want/need it, some point in the future. The way the law is structured, there is no limit on when you can reimburse yourself, so if you pay, say, $50,000 in medical expenses over the next 25 years, you would be able to take out up to $50,000 sometime in the future, completely tax-free.

            "text": "As others said, rules of thumb are just suggestions. Ultimately housing costs are personal.\n\nSome people want to get the most house they possibly can; others have a specific type of house in mind (for example, my dream home is 4 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, no more than 1,700 sqft... in my area, that's a cottage compared to the 8,000 sqft monstrosities that are around), which has a cost range that could be well within their means or well beyond their means.\n\nSome people live in ultra-high cost of living areas, where it's laughable to think that you could find housing that costs less than 28% of *gross* income; meanwhile, my wife and I pay 24% of my net income (and my wife works full time too) in a moderate-COL area.\n\nHome price is only a rule of thumb because other factors can be dramatically different. For example, a $400,000 loan at 4%  interest for 30 years costs $1,909.66; at 6% interest, it's $2,398. If we add in taxes, if we assume that $400k loan is based on a $500k home and taxes are 1% per year or $5,000, then your monthly payment at 4% is $2,326; if taxes are 2% per year or $10,000 and your mortgage is 6%, then your monthly payment becomes $3,232 - almost $1,000 more. I could comfortably afford a home payment of $2,326, but $3,232 is ridiculous to me. It is possible, however, that these wildly different payments could be on the exact same house sold for the exact same price with exactly the same amount down.\n\nMy *personal* measure when buying a home was that I wanted my wife and me to pay less than 25% of our combined take-home pay. At the time, that meant a mortgage payment of $1,925 or less. We wound up with a payment of $1,682, which we refinanced two years later to a payment of $1,500-ish. With that payment basically locked (it'll go up a little each year as insurance and taxes adjust with inflation), we knew that our mortgage would become a less- and less-significant part of our monthly budget as the years go on. Just four years after buying our home, our mortgage is now less than 15% of our take-home pay and 9% of our gross pay. To get to that initial $1,925 or less, with the amount we had saved for the home at the time, we could buy a home for $330k or less, so $330k became our absolute-max budget and $260k-$280k was our target range.\n\nIn other words, it's really whatever you're comfortable spending, factoring in everything specific to you."

It definitely took a while to tackle the first ceiling fan since I didn't know what I was doing, but the second one was up, working and balanced in under an hour. I figured an electrician would charge at least $500-600 for the job, so I easily came out on top. Same when it comes to basic car maintenance - engine air filter, cabin air filter, windshield wipers, no problem. In January I replaced my sump pump, and two years ago I replaced my hot water heater.\n\nIf I reasonably suspect that I can do the same job as a contractor can, with roughly the same quality outcome, then I'll take it on myself. But I also need to have the humility to recognize when a professional job would be worthwhile. Part of that is asking myself, would a future homeowner feel as compelled to tear up a floor that I install as I feel about this floor? My answer, given how much detail work needed to be done in my kitchen, was probably. If a future homeowner is going to feel compelled to tear up the floor, they're going to figure that into their offer, even if it isn't front of mind (it definitely factored into our offer, even though it wasn't a specific \"we are taking $2,500 off our offer because this floor sucks hard\"), so in the long run, I'm very comfortable hiring a pro for this one.\n\nI think I mentioned before - if this were my living room, I'd absolutely have done it myself. That room is a 600 sqft rectangle with 8 corners, none of which require all that much detail or precision (most walls have baseboard heat, so if the floor doesn't get all the way to the wall in a section or two, nobody will notice/care).

Those roles start in the $140-160k range. Same goes for big 4 strategy. I don't think you are looking at these roles, but if you are, it's a set salary (which, for some companies, is transparent to all employees). \n\nMy guess is you're looking at a consultant level role (consultant or senior associate), outside of strategy, which would put you in the $90-110k range + per diem / travel reimbursement + 10% bonus target, give or take. \n\nFor whatever it's worth, I recently (one year ago) left a small consulting firm that did not require travel. They didn't hire associates or consultants, but their pay scale was something like $90-100k for SC, $115-125k for managers (plus $2,500 per quarter utilization bonus if 80% utilized or higher), $140-160k for ages senior managers (plus utilization bonus), and $220-260k (plus $40-80k in sales related compensation). We consciously took about 15% less than we'd otherwise be willing to take as the trade for not traveling. \n\nMy current company (limited travel) is all over the map, but my understanding is that it's $50-65k + 5% bonus target for associates, $70-95k + 7% bonus target for consultants (2-6 years experience), $110-150k + 10% for senior consultants (5-15 years experience), $160-200k + 14% for managers (8-25 years experience), and $220-300k + 20% + stock award for principals (10+ years experience). Bump up everything by about 20% for the strategy folks. \n\nYour current salary is irrelevant to your new role, so don't think of your negotiating position in terms of your current salary. That will only serve to weaken you. Instead, think of your negotiating position in terms of what it will take to get you to yes and what you see as fair for the role.

            "text": "This is unrelated to the specific issue you are raising, but I need to comment on your situation, as it is dangerous for you. As an unmarried person with no income, you have VERY few protections in the event of unexpected circumstances. \n\nIf your boyfriend dies, your son will be entitled to 75% of your boyfriend's expected benefit amount upon full retirement age, and he will receive that until he turns 18. Because you are unmarried, you are entitled to 0%; if you were married, you would be entitled to 75% until your son turns 16 years old. \n\nIf he dies and has no will, then all of his assets will pass to your son and, depending on your state's specific laws, other members of his family, including his parents. Any assets that your son inherits is held essentially in limbo until he is either 18 or 21 years old. It's doubtful that you can have any jointly owned property since you have no income to support your ownership claim, so if he dies, that property automatically enters into probate. Since the primary beneficiary of your boyfriend's estate will likely be your son and since your son can't take control of the estate until he reaches adulthood, it is likely that property will be sold under an estate sale. \n\nThis has multiple negative elements: 1) you will lose a place to live; 2) the property will likely sell for less than market value; and 3) the proceeds of the sale are reduced by the share allocated to the executor of the estate, which is most likely one of his parents or an independently-appointed attorney. If you were married, then even if he were to own the property entirely himself (i.e. even if it is not jointly owned), you would be legally entitled to live there, and when the time comes, your child(ren) would be allowed to make a decision on whether to sell the property (if you agree to it); this type of rule varies by state, but this is the basic gist of things.\n\nIf your relationship disintegrates, you will not get any financial compensation except in the form of child support. In the eyes of the law, you are currently your own entity who is managing to survive with no income; in terms of your family, you provide the valuable service of caring for your child and, presumably, for your home as your full-time job. If you were married, then divorce would likely result in some form of alimony payments, which can help you to get back on your feet. \n\nAlso on the topic of breakup, since you have not worked in years, if you were to break up, you would have a harder time winning custody of your son - you need to be able to demonstrate an ability to support both yourself and your child, and since you aren't entitled to alimony, the only help you'd get from your boyfriend would be child support. Literally the first thing to do if you break up is to find employment. \n\nI'm saying all of this not as a judgement of your life - no judgement here! - but as a caution. You have virtually no protections as an unmarried, stay-at-home parent if life doesn't go as planned. If I were you, I would seriously consider finding employment, getting legally married, or, at the absolute least, drafting legal documents that establish a will, living will, medical directive, and any other possible documentation to help protect you in the event that your boyfriend passes or your relationship becomes untenable."

If you have $10m in an investment account, your family will be fine if you died, so life insurance becomes and unnecessary expense.  If you aren\u2019t self insured, you want enough insurance so that the payout can be invested and the person can draw off of it to replace some or all of your income. General recommendation is to get about 12 times you annual income in term life insurance. \n\nThe length of the term is influenced by a few things. It only needs to last until you expect to be self insured, so if you are forecasting out your savings, and see that 12 years from now you should have $2m which will be enough for your family, then getting a 10-15 year policy is a good idea. If you just had a kid and you want to cover until they are through college then a 25 year term would be appropriate. If you are more conservative and want to cover your entire working career, that\u2019s where 30+year term policies come into the picture. "

The yearly limit is 56k on 401ks:\n\n56k -19k -6k = 31k\n\nIf your plan allows it, you can still contribute an extra 31k to your 401k in after tax contributions. These are funds that taxes have been taken out but you opted to save. Now there is no tax benefit to doing this. However if your plan allows it, you can take the 31k and move it to your Roth IRA through what\u2019s called an \u201cin service withdrawal\u201d. This \u201cin service withdrawal\u201d allows you to move an extra 31k into your Roth IRA per year. THIS IS HUGE!!!!!! This doesn\u2019t impact your normal Roth IRA contribution of 6k. So assuming you did both you could contribute a full 37k into your Roth IRA in one year. 31k from the mega backdoor process (\u201cin service withdrawals\u201d) and 6k of normal contributions provided you don\u2019t hit income limits on the Roth. However if you do hit income limits you could still do the backdoor IRA process and still get the 6k in your Roth. Do not confuse the backdoor Roth IRA procedure with the mega backdoor Roth IRA procedure.

You then open a Traditional IRA -&gt; make a contribution of 6k -&gt; wait 3 business days -&gt; roll it over to your Roth IRA. \n\nMega backdoor IRA: this is there you make after tax contributions to your 401k then do \u201cin service withdrawals\u201d to your Roth IRA.\n\nHope this helps!"

Your spending habits looking forward should aim to continue to not be in debt.\n\nI would consider your first goal to be establishing an emergency fund.  It doesn't have to be huge since you have a relatively stable job, but just aim for something like $3000 for now.  You can quickly open a savings account with Ally which will give you a great interest rate, park that money there, and forget about it.  You should work diligently to never touch that money unless it would prevent you from accumulating high interest debt.\n\nOnce that is squared away, you probably want to start thinking about retirement.  The typical advice is to save 10-20% of your total (pre-tax) income specifically for retirement.  The TSP is a good place for that, and you should definitely contribute at least the minimum to get the full match.  You could consider opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard, and putting the rest of your retirement investments in there (mostly since IRAs offer a lot more flexibility compared to the TSP (which is essentially a 401(k)).\n\nIf you still have money left over that you want to invest, you can certainly open up a taxable brokerage account with Vanguard, but you'll probably need $3000 to make an initial deposit.

The earnings are a different story.  For the 401(k)/TSP, once you leave the company (or military in our cases) that is offering it, you can roll that money into a Roth IRA.  Then, I believe after 5 years, you can withdraw those contributions without a fee.  You'll have to double check me on that one.\n\nBut in my opinion, you might as well max out the Roth IRA ahead of the TSP, because then you don't have to bother with rolling it over (except the amount you contributed to it over the IRA)."

The issue is the IRS doesn't \"know\" that you are both earning incomes.\n\nIf you are both earning incomes, do you want those incomes to be treated as if they are filling up Married size tax brackets and have withholding done accordingly? That's what happens if you choose both choose \"Married\" check box. The result is your incomes get treated as if they're filling up brackets twice as roomy as the married tax brackets really are, and you underpay. That's why the adjustment is to lower allowances numbers to force more to be withheld.\n\nI suppose you could say that the default should be that if people use \"Married\" check box, they should have withholding done as if they are Single (presuming there is not more than two jobs), and there should be another check box called \"Married but only one earner\" that could instead apply the Married tax bracket size. \n\nInstead, the status quo is that \"Married\" check box means \"Married and only one earner\" and the \"Married but withhold at higher Single rate\" check box means \"Married and more than one earner, or more than one W-2.\" \n\nEither way, people would have to read the instructions."

Because she went back to school, and consolidated the loans, is there any way she'd be eligible for the PAYE plan? I don't see an income limit - is there one for eligibility?***\n\nI'm not 100% sure about this one. I would hate to guess.\n\n***Question 2: Let's say she is eligible for PAYE (or for those of you reading who are) - If you are currently enrolled in the IBR plan, making eligible payments, can you switch to the PAYE plan and retain the previous on-time payment numbers going forward with the new payment amount? Or are you resetting the counter to zero when you do this?***\n\nSwitching plans DOES NOT reset the clock to zero. Consolidation does, so only her payments made since she consolidated will count towards the 120 and the loan has to be a specific type of consolidation (if you look it should say Direct Consolidation I believe).\n\n***Question 3: Marriage (when that time comes) - With the new Tax laws, it might be harder to estimate at this point - but for the most part, did you file Married filing separately or married filing jointly? What makes either choice better in that situation? Do the new tax laws limiting property tax deductions change things?***\n\nI am on IBR for PSLF and my wife and I file separate so they only take into account my income when determining my payment amount each year. I can't recall how the other plans look at income off the top of my head but I'm pretty sure REPAYE takes both spouses income regardless of how you file. I don't remember how PAYE works because I know I'm not eligible because of disbursement date issue (goes back to question 1).\n\n***Question 4: Maternity Leave - How exactly does this work? Are you technically considered working full time while you are taking maternity leave? I assume after the maternity leave time allowed that she would no longer be considered full time if she extended her leave a bit.***\n\nIt really depends on what her employer says on the ECF. If she is full-time they will probably just say she is full time and works an average of 40 hours (or whatever) per work and not get into calculating it out. I don't think maternity leave itself would be an issue so much as it would be if she changed her hours per week after she went back to work to part time or something like that-that could cause a problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps out some."

(The patent runs out fairly soon, 2025, I think).\n\nThe reason why ETFs are more tax efficient than Mutual Funds is that all index funds need to re-balance their portfolios periodically to stay aligned to their indices.  This means they have to sell some positions and buy others.  If the positions they sell have gains, then they will have to pay capital gains taxes, which they will pass on to you if held in a taxable account.  \n\nETFs can re-balance in a much more tax efficient way (which causes considerably fewer taxable events) than Mutual Funds can.  So, ETFs are more tax efficient in taxable accounts.  \n\nExcept for Vanguard, who figured out how to do the re-balancing in their mirroring ETFs and import that into the Mutual Funds in a tax efficient way, and then were clever enough to patent it.\n\n"

The best investment for a beginner is probably to put your money in your broker's Target Date Index Fund, with a target date close to your retirement age.  These will have a huge diversification of investments, usually total US stock market, total International stock market, and a bond fund.  They will automatically re-balance for you, and they will get more conservative (more bond funds in the portfolio) as you get closer to the target date.  They used to be expensive.

The basis of a lot of this goes back to the 1969 government housing regulation that said 25% (gross) of a households income would be the most a landlord could charge for rent in public housing. This number was then bumped up to 30% a few decades later. This was the first \"max rent\" ceiling.\n\nIn reality it's situation dependent which leads to more confusion.  If you don't have a car, for example, you can spend more on housing since you have dropped another expense. The more money you make, the more you can stretch these numbers as well, since other costs don't tend to rise at the same rate. Someone making 90k doesn't need to spend 3x on food, gasoline, utilities, etc than someone making 30k.\n\nTl;DR: 25-30% gross is probably the most realistic numbers for middle income individuals, but again this is meant as a \"max value\". Poorer individuals will likely have to go higher, richer individuals can usually go lower. Many cities implement \"40x rules\" saying you must make annually 40x the monthly rent. After you do some simple math you see this is a fancy way of saying rent can't exceed 30% of your monthly income."

When you have a job as a regular employee, in addition to income tax, you also pay half of what's often referred to as payroll taxes or FICA taxes (6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare). Your employer pays the other half. Since these are flat rates, they come out of your paycheck and don't really show up anywhere on your federal income tax return unless there was an error in the withholding. When you are self-employed, you have to pay both the employer and employee halves of those taxes, for a total of 15.3%, on 92.35% of your net profits, and that's referred to as self-employment taxes. This gets calculated on Schedule SE which is filed along with your income tax return.

Each state is going to look at you as a high $500,000 earner, and say: \"well your first $10,000 is free, but we want our cut of the other $490,000 income you earned, which would be $49000 / 50 = $980\".\n\nSo with this example you can see how by earning more money in other states (doesn't matter if it's you or your wife), you can owe more tax in the states that do have an income tax.

Am I understanding that correctly?\n\nEither one you want.  You can either reinvest dividends automatically and pay out of pocket (either with increased paycheck withholding, or estimated taxes), or you can have dividends go to settlement fund, pull out the right amount for taxes, and then reinvest the rest manually.\n\nReally though, the dividend tax hit is not bad, and almost not noticeable until you have a lot of taxable stuff.\n\nSay you have a quarter of a *million* in taxable investments and it's all in total market equities, the tax drag is like less than a thousand per year if you're in the 15% bracket.\n\n(Also this is the importance of like not holding REIT in taxable, because the tax drag gets a lot larger)"

Everything else is considered pretax (even gains from after-tax contributions).\n\nSo say you have $50k in your IRA and your last 8606 basis is $5k (line 14 or whatever).  Then you would roll over $45k to your 401k, leaving $5k to convert to Roth without incurring any tax.\n\nAlternatively, and probably better, just convert the roth first (since you know the exact basis $$), and make sure to rollover the rest to a 401k before Dec31.  All that matters is that you clear out your pretax $$ by Dec31, the order doesn't matter beyond that.\n\nAlso if you contribute more during the year you do the conversion, that can of course be converted to Roth too, just remember to file 8606 again."

But for someone else who lives less rurally than I do, that\u2019s probably an easy win for them.  Ditto grocery budget. Mines probably a bit higher than usual for two adults and three pets, but we eat out very rarely. If I don\u2019t need a $200 restaurant budget, why can\u2019t I dump some of that money into better ingredients for home cooked meals?  On the other hand, we\u2019ve seen people spending $1000 a month on groceries and $400 on eating out...that\u2019s a pretty big chunk of change. \n\nI can\u2019t agree that planning isn\u2019t feasible. Lots of people graduate with some horrendous student loans. Some would do so no matter what their financial education looks like. But some college students would think twice about a second round at the bar if they realized that every dollar of their loan money they spent needed to be paid back 1.8 times over (6.8% loan for 20 years. If you borrowed $20k, you\u2019ll pay back $36,640).  If that fifteen dollar pitcher of beer is really $27 in repayment...do you want it that much?  If you do, fine, chase that dream!  Make it work. Just know what it\u2019ll really cost you. \n\nRight now, I\u2019m teetering on the edge of a ridiculous lifestyle purchase. It\u2019s relatively expensive, but will offer hours of recreation and entertainment. For privacy\u2019s sake, let\u2019s call it a Tesla X. (It\u2019s not really) I\u2019m about to drop high five figures on a vehicle, when I have one that does the job well. I mostly have the cash for this purchase, but will probably have to take out a loan for part of the purchase. We\u2019ll use it several times a month, and honestly, probably use it to make some money and offset the cost of ownership. It fulfills a lot of life goals and is something I\u2019ve been planning to do for years.  I can make the money work. I\u2019ve got some bonds to cash in and a brokerage account to tap and I\u2019ll hold my breath until some other obligations are over, but in five years?  I\u2019ll be ecstatic I jumped at this opportunity when I did.  And college me will be so proud of grown up me for accomplishing the \u201cbig goal\u201d we set fifteen years ago. \n\nOn the other hand, I can do this BECAUSE I planned and was smart with my money for the last twenty years. I\u2019ve saved my pennies and told myself no and weighed my purchases and vacations and splurges.  I\u2019ve curated a behavior style that mostly makes my own coffee, drinks interesting beers by the six pack from the liquor store, cooks a mean fillet, and buys most of my clothes at the thrift store.  I picked a college that offered me a full scholarship. I bought a house I can comfortably afford, a car that I\u2019ll happily drive into the ground, and married someone who shares those values.  That\u2019s giving me the ability to metaphorically stumble into a Tesla store this morning and say, \u201cI like the red one, gimme a quote.\u201d\n\nSo no. Not every decision is fully optimized.

In 30 years, you could do a transfer of the policy into an annuity that will spit out an income stream.  When you do that, the income is taxed, but hopefully it\u2019s not taxed as hard as it is right now.  \n\nAnother benefit of the VUL is that you can rebalance the account without having to realize the gain in assets. If you buy a share of XYZ Fund at $100, and it goes to $200, you can sell that share of the fund inside the insurance policy and not pay capital gains on the $100. Instead, you keep all $200 and buy another fund.  \n\nThe kicker on life insurance policies is in the details. \n\nQuestions to ask and understand:\nWhat are the fees?  How much does that drag on your gains?  What happens if I decide this isn\u2019t working for me in two years? Five? Ten? Thirty?  How much do i get back out in cash, or what are my options to change it to something more fitting?  What kinds of life changes should trigger a relook at this financial choice?  What\u2019s the worst that could happen?  What\u2019s the best?  What happens if I do nothing and just invest this money this year?  Next year?  When I die?  If I do die, who will talk to my beneficiary about next steps?  What would be the best solution if my beneficiary is in college?  Newly married and buying a house? Retiring in five years? Retired?  \n\nThese are complicated products.  I\u2019m not a huge fan unless I can get a client to understand what we\u2019re doing, why, what happens if we don\u2019t, and what are the second and third order effects for both scenarios, best case and worst case.  Ideally, they hear me out and think about it for a bit, gnaw on the problem, and come back with questions before the decision is made because these are usually painful to get out of in the early years. \n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, look at what you\u2019re getting for the percentage of investments. It better not just be picking funds!  The insurance is a good example of this firm understanding your desires and needs and meeting them. They should also offer tax planning, perhaps a CPA on staff for returns.  As your business grows, they might provide 401k options or other profit sharing methods for employees. If you need any Professional services for any reason I bet they have a Rolodex of vetted partners that other clients have been very happy with.  Estate planning, charitable giving...checking their website, they also offer business planning.  As your business grows, buy-sell agreements, key person deals and retention, and someone to bounce ideas off of may very well be worth the1%/ $1000 a year fee. \n\nIf the website is a pile of hooey, though, kick \u2018em to the curb and find a new firm that does do what you want them to."

I work at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (nothing high up, just a researcher) and I wanted to talk about your question about bank failures.\n\nThe vast majority of banks are insured by the FDIC, which protects your bank deposits in the event of a failure. Now I know what you are thinking, \"if my bank fails I dont want to have to go through some government bureaucracy to get my money back!\", but that's not how it works.\n\nWhen a bank fails, the FDIC essentially takes ownership of the bank. So If you go and use your debit card or an atm, that will still work. The only thing different is the the fdic handles those transactions.\n\nTypically this doesnt last long, as we will sell the bank to another party, and your money will essentially be moved to another bank. FDIC insurance protects you up to $250,000, so unless you've got that kind of cheddar you are fine.\n\nIt is very unlikely that you are not fdic insured, but you can check your bank. If you are fdic insured the only way you could lose your money is a collapse of the us government. In that's scenario dollars dont really mean anything."

When I do that, I set aside $75 for my Girlfriends priorities (mainly vacation) and $75 for my priorities (new pc and VR setup).\n\nSo when Christmas time came, and I had over a thousand sitting in that PC/VR budget line, I spent the whole damn thing without any guilt at all. I don't know about you, but for me the guilt of spending on myself primarily comes from the feeling of taking money from someone else. I love my girlfriend, I don't want to take money away from her. I wan't to have enough money for us to spend and save for all of our priorities.\n\nBefore I was budgeting, I always had the feeling that I was taking money from my GF or someone else. I could have $20k sitting in my account, and I would still have that feeling. Like, \"what if we need that money for a vacation at some point?\". Fully accounting for everything in that budget totally solved that issue for me, and I think it would really help you as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStart a budget, write down all your expenses (including annual and irregular expenses, try and budget for those monthly), set aside savings, and then see what is left over. Let's say you have $300 left over per month. Maybe you evenly split that between that between you, your wife, and your kid. Maybe you give your kid half, and then split the other half with your wife. Maybe you give all 3 of you 25%, and then leave the last 25% for stuff together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo matter how you do it, as long as you have a full budget you won't have to worry about \"taking\" from anything anymore.

If you don't address the underlying causes that put you in this position, then those lower monthly payments will unfortunately enable you to go and get more debt. You need to make sure that you are absolutely committed to paying these off before you consider consolidation.\n\nIf I were you, I would put my nose to the grindstone and snowball this debt for a trial period of your choosing. Maybe a year, maybe a half a year, whatever you think will be necessary to assess whether or not you are disciplined enough to pay down the debt without adding more cc debt. If you stick to your budget, dutifully pay these loans down, avoid additional debt, and want to get out of debt faster, then consolidate the rest of it.\n\nHowever, if you find yourself struggling to avoid adding new cc debt, then don't get the consolidation loan. Also note that most consolidation loans have terms of about 3 years or so. So you will likely want to pay more than their minimum payments to pay them off faster. If you do go that route, I would recommend paying an amount equivalent or similar to your old CC monthly payment. That way the extra will go to principal.\n\nAdditonally, with $24k in CC debt your credit score is likely going to be garbage, and you probably won't get good terms. Your utilization is simply too high right now. If you snowball (or avalanche) for a while, then your utilization will go down, your credit score will improve, and you will hopefully get better terms on a loan."

It used to be that you at least got a nice tax break for all that interest, but now fewer people can claim that tax break due to the higher standard deduction.

You're going to fairly comfortably live off $75k a year.  In 5 years, when you're salary is $110k, you can live off of $89k (adjusting for inflation).  That's about $20k extra to invest.

The cash that would be allocated to paying those can be used to pay off other small debts.  When all the small debts are paid, you can use all that extra monthly cash to pay towards the big one.  This is generally referred to as the Snowball Method of debt payoff.  It frees up cash flow the fastest, and to a lot of people, cash flow is more important than saving 2% on interest.\n\nFor example, if you pay off $20k of those $23k public loans, maybe you pay off all but one $3k loan out of the bunch.  You go from paying $230/month towards them to paying $30/month.  Or, whatever it ends up being.  That difference of $200 continues to be applied toward that last $3k public loan.  But, if some financial hardship happens, you can stop paying that $200 toward the loan and put it somewhere else each month.\n\nOn the other hand, if you chunk the whole $20k toward the private loan, cash flow doesn't change.  The loan balance goes down, but you still owe the same amount every month until it is paid off.  If that same financial hardship happens, you have no flexibility to adjust payments."

What's your interest rate on this?  If it's anything over ~5%, this should be dealt with ASAP.

Enjoy the rest - you've set your savings/investing goals, be happy that you're meeting them and enjoy your life. If that means you have the money to turn that stay-cation into an enjoyable week sipping fruity drinks on a white sandy beach - enjoy it! You won't look back 40 years from now and say \"I really wish I hadn't had that enjoyable vacation in my early 30's... I could have retired 2 weeks earlier instead\", well I can't promise you won't but I certainly won't."

If you pay 100% of the premium, then you get the full 70% of your pay with no taxes at all due on that money. If they pay it, then it is taxable income. If you split it, then it's partially taxed.  \n\n\nFor most people with an average or higher income, getting 70% of it after taxes is adequate to maintain their current spending (since you won't have to pay income tax, SS, etc out of the checks, won't be contributing to the 401k or other retirement plan(s) since you don't have income).   \n\n\nNext up:  \nHow tight is your budget. If you currently save 30% of your gross income, then getting 70% of it, even if it is taxed, is likely to be more than adequate to cover you in the event you become disabled.

Our dog is basically our child and we would not hesitate to drop $10-20k to save/cure him. \n2. We take our dog to work every day which means that he would be more susceptible to illness / injury with many other dogs around. \n3. $30 / month is not an issue with our budget - especially with vet prices in HCOL\n4.

Negotiate for the best price and use your costco price as your primary quote. If you dot have costco, use the truecar scale and aim for the \"exceptional\" value price.\n\nGo to dealerships in the area or email them, see if they will be able to beat the price.\n\nAlways go with someone that can keep you form making a quick decision.\nAlso, you can negotiate for extras as well. Weathermats/mudguards/tint/etc...all of these are low cost to the dealership.\n\nSo if a place cant beat or come close to the price, maybe they will throw in free tint/mats/etc so the value matches and you end up getting these things thrown in.\n\n"

An IRA is typically something you (the individual) open to save for retirement.\n\nAssuming you are referring to a company's 401(k) plan:\n\nEligibility date:  There is usually a waiting period, outlined in the plan documents, before you can begin participating in a 401(k).\n\nOnce eligible, you can contribute whatever percent of your salary you choose pre-tax or post-tax, the later being known as a 'Roth 401(k).'\n\nApplicable limits: For 2019, one can contribute up to $19,000 if below age 50.  If above age 50, you can add an additional $6000 (totaling $25,000) in 'catch up' contributions.\n\nInvestment funds: most employers choose an investment company (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab) to administer their plan.  The menu of fund choices will be decided, typically by a committee or employer, based on what's available from that investment company or with guidance from that investment company.  You then choose from the menu of investment options to create your desired portfolio.\n\nRollovers: if you have money in an IRA or other 401(k), 403(b) outside of this plan (all these are known as 'qualified' retirement vehicles) you can 'roll over' (or transfer) those funds into your new 401(k).\n\nSafe Harbor plan: A safe harbor plan is set up by a company when it wants to avoid the nondiscrimination test.  In short, the company agrees to give each employee a certain 'match' so if there is a difference in the amount various employees (e.g. those that are highly paid versus those that are not) are contributing, the company does not get in trouble with the IRS.  This sounds complicated, but basically the IRS says ALL employees should be able to take advantage of these retirement vehicles, not just the executives (of any company) using them to avoid taxes while us plebs slog away unable to contribute due to low wages.\n\nProfit Share: the company takes excess revenue (profit) each year and makes it available as a 'bonus' contribution to your 401(k) above and beyond your contributions and the match (up to $55,000 total).\n\nI hope that helps.\n\n"

            "text": "How should we go about saving for and/or financing a newer SUV? Hi all, I hope you can give me some good ideas. I apologize for any errors. I worried so much that I didn't get much sleep last night. My husband and I are 25. We live in WI. My husband and father put a new muffler on our '94 Jeep yesterday. My dad (a car guy of 40+ years who knows the in and outs of many cars) noted that we are going to need a new car/SUV within a year. Our frame is rusting away and will soon affect the motor. We need an SUV because we have a pop-up and already need more space than our Jeep Grand Cherokee has.\n\nWhat is the best way to go about saving for a newer SUV? I had never looked up the costs of new SUVs before and didn't realize that if you want a reliable one with under 100,000 miles, you would need to pay $9,000+. \n\nWe have about $6,000 in our savings(in a high yield Marcus savings account). We expect to get $6,000+ from our tax refund(our way of saving.....please don't judge) according to past years and the online tax calculator I did with my husband's W2(and I am a stay at home mom). We contribute $545.24 a month to our HSA($272.62 every other week) and have $2,378 in there now. My husband contributes 8% to his 401k and 4% to his Roth 401k(he just opened that Roth one this month). His employer matches up to 5% on 10%.\n\nTheir plan is that we need to get a new one by November...9 months away. I was thinking about almost stopping our HSA contributions or a while unless we suddenly empty out the HSA for emergancy care and slowing down or stopping the contributions to his 401K. We contribute almost $10,900 in 9 months between those three things I figure. He wanted to learn more about taking a loan from his 401K. I was pretty sure that was a bad idea. \n\nOr we could finance in some way? We have good credit (he is about 755; I am 785 but don't have a job), but a few places have told him his credit history isn't long enough (he never went to college or had a car loan). What kind of rate might we get? What amount of downpayment would be best in our situation do you think?\n\nThis is a bit complicated by the fact that I have a private student loan of $10,235 at 4.81% and $28,241 in federal loans on an IBR plan. For the private loan, they require $215. I pay $316. I was planning on using $2000 of our tax refund to go towards a new vehicle and put the rest to my private student loan. I'm doing the avalanch method, and if I don't use more of our tax refund, it would be paid off in April of 2020(and them all around September of 2022). I would think that a car loan rate would be less than the 4.81%???\n\nI'm sorry for the long post, but I wanted to give a good picture of our options. What do you think would be a good plan for saving for a SUV while hopefully not sabataging my loan repayment plans? I would be happy to answer any other questions. Please go easy on me! This is our first time buying a vehicle. My parents were kind enough to gift us the two ones we have now. \n"

They end up having a lot of the same qualities that bonds do (regular dividends, more stable than the wider market).\n\nSome focus on home financing (mortgages), which you would want to avoid for the same reason as bonds, but many are property management, hotels and resorts, storage companies, etc...\n\nI suspect you'd have to invest in individual REITs though, as most REIT-based funds probably have some of the mortgage-based REITs in the mix.\n\nEdit: Here's some examples I pulled from a screener:\n\n* **SPG** \\- Simon Property Group - 23.88% 10yr annualized total return - mix of retail, dining, and entertainment\n* **CCI** \\- Crown Castle International Corp - 21.32% 10yr annualized total return - cell towers and fiberoptics\n* **EXR** \\- Extra Space Storage Inc - 30.03% 10yr annualized total return - storage units\n* **EQIX** \\- Equinix Inc - 24.3% 10yr annualized total return - data centers"

There are common stocks that have done even better if you only look at the best ones out there (for example, Netflix has the same metric at 54.19%).\n\nModerate/average REITs are in the 11.5-15.5% range, which still sounds good, but for context consider that a Nasdaq index fund has a \\~16.5% 10yr annualized return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm not sure I agree with the \"incredibly risky\" description the other poster used though. REITs are individual companies like any other, and investing in a single company/stock always has risk. That's why normally you'd look at an REIT-based fund, but in this case that would expose you to loan-based REITs. So to avoid that you'd just have to approach this as investing in selected companies rather than picking a fund that is diversified by default - do your research, invest in multiple REITs that have exposure to different sectors, and focus on fundamentals around long-term stability and growth.

If you want methods that aren't just based on statistics, you can go through other means (such as peer-to-peer lending), but I'd guess that rates are generally going to be cheaper by going through institutions that use your credit score, if your credit score is at least decent."

You're also probably looking at slightly higher utility costs since the house is probably a bigger space than an apartment, and at an apartment your maintenance is covered and you may only be paying for some of the utilities. In a house, you're paying for all the utilities and maintenance yourself.\n\nPlus you'll probably have to pay for at least some overlapping time between getting out of your apartment and getting into a house, so you may have to pay for a week (or a day, or 2 months) for the house while you're finishing out your current apartment lease.\n\nSo basically, the shorter the period of time that you plan to own the house, the more it'll cost you. Houses may appreciate or depreciate (gain or lose value) over time, but other than just being conservative and assuming that the market will suck a bit when you go to sell, it's best not to make other assumptions about the value of the house going up over time, since nobody knows until they go to sell (anyone telling you otherwise is just guessing)."

No.  But not everything has to be.  Some things you do because they make you happy.\n\nIf you want to buy new, here's my advice on getting the best deal you can.\n\n1.  Don't buy emotionally.  Don't fall in love with a car and say \"I have to have it!\"  That's going to get you taken for a ride.  Especially when you're buying new, there will be tons of nearly-identical cars at a variety of dealers.  You don't have to have one particular one.\n\n2.  Be as flexible as you can be.  The more you insist on a particular configuration (i.e. color, a particular feature package, etc.) the less room there will be to save money on something the dealership wants to get rid of.\n\n3.  Do your research.  Figure out what all the options mean, figure out what the average cost of that car is, etc.  The dealer is always going to know more than you, but you should still know as much as you can.  Knowledge is power.\n\n4.  When talking price, don't let them distract you.  Don't talk monthly payments, don't talk about prices with trade-ins subtracted, be very clear with them that you want the car for $X out the door.  No additional taxes or fees added in.  They'll fight you every step of the way and try to insist that this fee or that one is mandatory, but none of them are.  Or rather they might be, but they can compensate for that by reducing the sale price of the vehicle.\n\n5.  Know what your opening offer and your walk-away prices are when going into the dealership.  You figure this out from doing your research.  If they can't meet your walk-away price, then walk away.\n\n6.  Be patient.  It may take you several visits to different dealerships and quite a bit of time at each one before you finally buy something for the price you want.  If your walk-away price is reasonable, you'll eventually find a dealership willing to sell it to you for that price.\n\n7.  If you're financing, find out what kind of financing you can get from a third-party before you start shopping.  You might end up going with the dealer's financing, especially if they're running a 0% offer, but it's good to have a point of comparison."

If you have a card that gives cash back, use that card for that, or get a card that gives cash back specifically in order to pay those monthly expenses. If you are responsible with your credit cards and either do not use them or do not accrue debt on them, there is no reason to close them. Keep building your credit history."

We have chosen less lucrative work that aligns well with our values so for us it\u2019s worth it to be \u2018poorer\u2019, even if we have to remind ourselves of that while waiting a decade to renovate or do any traveling.

We were able to pause our regular investment contributions temporarily, change our mortgage payments from accelerated bi-weekly to just the minimum required, and dip into our emergency fund to make up the remaining anticipated monthly shortfall.

            "text": "This will be a controversial answer so make sure to juxtapose it with others but this is my advice:\n\nDon't worry with servicing your debt until your junior or senior year. You should be focusing on school and not on personal finance at the moment.\n\nYou shouldn't worry about investing, either. You probably don't have a lot of disposable income. Transaction costs will not justify investing in an account to remain liquid because you'll probably need to dip into it here and there. Honestly I would suggest just keeping your cash in a checking account. If you had an extra 3 or 4k it would be a different story, for now you're worried about meeting your short term debt obligations.\n\nSo, the advice I'll be providing is going to assume you're towards the end of college, have built up some of that savings I was talking about (make sure to choose a bank without many fees and overdraft protection, like CapitalOne!), and are more financially stable/have a better idea of your financial future.\n\nAlways start with the debt. Paying off your student loans will be your number one financial priority for as long as you continue to have them.\n\nHere's a good rule of thumb: Determine all your essential expenses, such as food, gas, electricity, rent, phone bill, etc. From the remainder, put 50% towards your student loans, 30% to entertainment (which includes literally all non-essentials, such as going out to eat with friends or buying a video game) and the final 20% to savings. This will serve as your emergency fund as well for the time being.\n\nAs you amass more income, your budget should change based on your opportunities and focus. It is my opinion the money is better put to use in your current state on other things than your IRA, but it is up to your tolerance of frugality to determine that.\n\nTL;DR: Income - Essentials = Leftovers. Leftovers = 50% debt, 30% pleasure, 20% savings. Retirement is a great way to put that last 20% to use but an IRA probably wouldn't be financially strategic to you at this time. I suggest a mutual fund, but your employer won't match contributions (if you currently have such an arrangement). Key: Focus on your future. It may be smarter to focus on school in the short term than your long-term financial health because it may provide better economic opportunities in the long run."

That's the best way to earn credit. Find a card that doesn't have an annual fee ([here you go](http://comparecards.com/)), and as long as you cover that bill you won't pay a dime extra.

So \"really anytime\".\n\nLooking further into the history of the yield inversion, the true \"marker\" is an inverted yield over a full financial quarter, and even then it's taken up to two years from the start of inversion to the official recognition of recession. And even then,  it's only really held in the US - Japan doesn't see any correlation whatsoever with yield curves, the UK is mixed.\n\n**Disclaimer: Timing the market is almost always a bad idea**.\n\nGiven the signals, a conservative route for trying to time the market could be to sit on the funds now (assuming your IRA holds in an interest-bearing account when not invested; not all do) and wait until the news and public say that the market is *starting to recover after bottoming out*, since you'll be able to invest principal + interest at near the bottom of the price hole; just investing when the news says there's a recession means you'll likely catch a price as it's still sliding. However, that does mean that if the recession is a bit of a way off, you lose the higher-rate growth that invested funds have, and the further off the peak / cliff are, the more likely the bottom of the recession to be where prices are now - not all recessions see 50% market-value-loss like 2008; they just have to be 6 months of economic constriction.\n\nA riskier route would be to invest now, and get out the day you see news reports that a recession has started. That way you could try to catch the vested-funds growth rate, and odds are *okay* that if you're quick about it you'll still sell above your purchase price, even if you're catching a bit of the drop instead of the peak. Then hold as cash until news / public say the market is *starting to recover after bottoming out*. If your IRA doesn't hold unvested funds in an interest-bearing account, you should do some form of this, since otherwise you're losing value to inflation at all times.\n\nGiven that we don't know when, if, or how bad a recession will be, and that they're a natural part of the market behavior anyway, the traditional wisdom for someone with a long time-scale is to just go ahead and buy-and-hold, ride out the drop, because the market value will eventually recover on the other side. ((Note: this doesn't apply to individual stocks, just full indexes / economies)) **This is what I think you should do.** It won't make you the richest person on earth, but for every person who gets rich off ~~clever~~ **lucky** timing of the market there are maybe a dozen that do it badly and lose their shirt; when it comes to investing (and especially retirement savings), doing \"average\" will generally do well enough, and the risk of being clever (even in an attempt to be \"safer\") is higher than you imagine.\n\nYou're not an expert (or you wouldn't be asking this question), so just aim for average retuns. Remember: The average US retirement savings for people in their 60's was [$172k in 2017](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011216/average-retirement-savings-age-2016.asp), and most manage not to be homeless with that - with the time you have left, just putting $5k/yr in your mattress until you're 63 would give you more than that; average market returns will do far better (S&amp;P 7% long-term average after inflation); even conservative holdings (treasury bonds, etc) will put you better off, since they roughly match inflation where your mattress doesn't. Don't try to be fancy or clever; this is one of those things where \"good enough\" *really is good enough*."

So, technically, if you can afford to rent you can afford to buy the sort of place you're renting.\n\nIn an individual sense: It's (relatively) true in some places, not in others, and presumes that the full cost or rent is paid by is a single-finance unit (family or individual). If you're renting with roommates you wouldn't legally entangle yourselves in home ownership with, you can't afford to buy.\n\nUsually, these sorts of statements are advertising some sort of program with substantial limits - total value of property, maximum household income, area of purchase (rural or urban-revitalization most common), or personal background (VA). Some of them have rough terms - FHA's require PMI for the life of the loan and have to be refinanced into a traditional mortgage to remove, which incurs a future cost.\n\nThis is also usually an advertising statement and obscures the point that if you're not putting a substantial amount down on a mortgage, you're most likely going to be underwater (owing more than the property value) for quite a while.\n\nIf you have the savings and credit for a mortgage, you'll need to start looking into things like your preferred monthly payment (to establish budget), finding a realtor to act as buyer's agent, and shop around for the best rate from a lender through preapproval.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll need to be setting aside money in addition to mortgage payments to cover repairs, appliance replacements, and other associated costs of homeownership - all things that rent covers but a mortgage doesn't. Utilities may also have been rolled into rent but won't be in a mortgage. Make sure you take both into account when you plan the budget for estimating how much you can pay each month.\n\nAlso: remember that there are advantages to renting. Repairs and replacements aren't your responsibility; if your neighbors suck you can move; if you get a job offer across the country it's easier to relocate; yardwork (sometimes) isn't your responsibility; if your school district decreases in quality you can relocate. That flexibility is positive value to some people, others see it as instability and a negative. Make sure you know where you stand on that point."

I'm not saying any of this is impossible with an agreement. I'm saying it's easier with marriage, because while marriage isn't magic, it \\*is\\* deeply ingrained in our legal structure in many ways that make a lot of things much simpler in the long run.

Divorces are \\*almost\\* better in that you have to go through a legal process, which gets unemotional parties involved to mediate and try to make the end result as equal as possible. Without that, it's two people in various states of emotional distress trying to navigate a bunch of pitfalls left and right.\n\nThe home valuation differentiation is demonstrative. In a breakup, odds are she, as the minority owner, would have to be bought out, so she has incentive to have the home valued highly. You, as the one paying, have incentive for it to be valued lower. How do you reconcile that, when you're already going through emotional turmoil?\n\nWhen I say things are \"cleaner\", I mean nobody gets to feel slighted if things go wrong. There's equal claim to all marital assets, so at least ostensibly each party should receive an equal share during the division. ((There are exceptions, i.e. at-fault parties owing damages, where the division is directly unequal, and nonfinancial divisions like child custody that have to be given a financial equivalency, so one party on paper winds up with a higher dollar amount)) The divorce process, when not amicable, typically involves hiring an independent third party to go through and appraise all joint assets, which gives an impartial list of values to balance up.\n\nBut with a buy-in plan? Something goes bad before she's bought up to an equal share and she'll necessarily get the short end of the stick - has to move because she clearly has less claim to the property, and she's got to hope you either buy her out immediately or she's stuck owning a real estate liability that she neither occupies nor generates income from and hoping that you're covering all bills, because she's obligated to meet them as an owner. You really think she's not going to cause you problems in that situation? \"Sale subject to third-party approval\" is a red flag on a house listing, decreasing offers and lowering the price, and that's assuming she doesn't just refuse the sale for one reason or another. People do crazy things when they think they've been treated badly.\n\nYou have every reason not to do it this way. She has even more. However.\n\nI think I saw you say in another comment that getting married is against your religion? I'm not sure if that's true or not, but if it is you could either pursue a common-law marriage (if you're in one of the 9 US jurisdictions that allow it) or go through a legal marriage but not go through a religious ceremony. That said, I know religion is not generally fond of \"loopholes\". If you're that committed to both your religion and this woman, you should go sit down with a lawyer and pay them some time to sort out the right thing to do here. Someone who's committed enough to religious prescriptions about marriage but not to actively seek out marriage within the community is...very unusual.\n\nGood luck."

Their purpose is to serve the local population. In this context, dorms being often given to seniors makes (some) sense, since older students are more likely to want to live away from their parents. \n\nAdditionally, in a very dense city like NYC, it's possible that the school's offered housing is below market (or high-quality) for the neighborhood, and is VERY convenient to classes, so they're a more competitive option and they become a reward/luxury for students in their last year. It's not dissimilar to some other colleges that reserve single-occupancy dorm rooms for seniors.\n\nIf I had to guess, this is probably for a City University of New York school. CUNY has 24 campuses, 4 of which there are in Brooklyn, 3 of which are Senior Colleges, one of which is right on the edge of Brooklyn facing Manhattan - housing convenient to those campuses is probably pretty freaking tight, so dorms are going to have a strange incentive structure.

            "text": "Personally, I've heavily prioritized retirement over saving to buy a house. My justification is a bit nonstandard, so don't take it as gospel.\n\n&gt;One of the primary arguments for having a house that people have used on me is having now home payment when you retire. A relatively typical working career for someone coming out of undergraduate will be about 40 years, ages 24-64. ((Go with me here, it makes the numbers clean)) Given that a normal mortgage is 30 years, that means having a paid off house at the end of a typical working career leaves 10 years of no mortgage payments.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Under the 2019 limits, people under 50 can contribute $19k to a 401(k) (discounting employer match) and $6k to an IRA, not counting after-tax or \"backdoor\" conversions, and over 50 there are allowed catch-up payments of $6k and $1k, respectively. So under 50 the total max contribution is $25k, and over 50 it's $32k.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In short, if you max out retirement savings from 24-33 and then buy a house, the $250k contributed over 10 years of maxing out retirement contributions and saving for a downpayment at a lower rate will be worth $1.9mil after 30 years of 7% average growth even if you never contribute another dime and hadn't vested it in anything in the 10 years of contributions. Additionally, you'll have the equity and wealth generation from the house value accrual as well, with the last mortgage payment happening at 64 and thus avoiding housing payments in retirement.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; If you go the other way and buy a house up front, you'll have 10 years at the end to max out contributions totalling $320k, and only one year of it will have even 10 years of 7% growth - which won't even double that year's contribution; the total is more like 40% total growth ballpark, for $550k-ish. While the house would've had longer to grow in value, that's illiquid wealth that is difficult to realize.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TL;DR, taking longer to save for a home downpayment and piling into retirement savings early can result in having \\~$1.4mil more in liquid assets than buying a house early.\n\nI know that's simplistic and misses a lot of things - it doesn't account for retirement contributions made while making mortgage payments in either scenario; it doesn't account for the fact that the house someone would move into at 24 is generally a \"starter home\" and they likely won't stay in it for all 40 years, pushing the mortgage-payoff date back when they size-up; it doesn't account for the costs of upkeep on a home, nor renovation; it doesn't account for shorter-term mortgages, or later retirement dates, or any strategies involving selling a not-paid-off house to downsize into a smaller/cheaper one with no mortgage partway through this 40-year period.\n\nWhat it *does* is show that it's largely better to work on saving for retirement **faster** than for a mortgage downpayment, because the growth potential for retirement savings is much better served by early-entry and duration of investment. \"Catch-up\" contributions do not actually make up for lost time.\n\nIt also heavily reflects my personal preference for the flexibility of liquid assets at retirement. Local real estate markets can cycle up and down fairly widely, even if the national one doesn't, and I can go on Redfin right now and find at least a dozen houses in my and neighboring counties built 30 years ago that are listed barely above the cost of land for any number of reasons - essentially worthless. Real estate is not a zero-effort investment - treating a house I live in as a bank account is not something that I'm comfortable with.\n\nSo to answer your question more directly: How do **I** juggle saving for a house and for retirement?\n\n&gt;I'm a 28yo single male, no kids, college degree. Average income for my HCOL/high-income county.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'm maxing out my tax-advantaged retirement funds. To the point of pulling the year's Roth IRA contribution out of my emergency fund since it constitutes less than 3mo's expenses and keeps me within the 3-6mo guideline, for a January-2 lump-sum contribution. 401(k) is levelled to buy-in roughly equally throughout the year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;((note: This is where I diverge from the Prime Directive the most. PD says to contribute 15-20% of income to retirement, I'm overshooting that by maxing out. Also, pulling out of emergency savings isn't *great* \\- I justify it because doing so still leaves me within the recommended range, but that's not true for budgets below $2k/mo))  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After that, my paycheck is direct-deposited in two accounts: the one I pay bills out of gets a set amount for every paycheck so that my budget never inflates; everything beyond that goes into high-yield savings, to catch bonuses, pay raises, and tax/withholding adjustments.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This gets a bit messy: I've estimated the size of mortgage I'm willing to handle, and approximated a budget for that. So my emergency savings limit is actually 5-6mo expenses *at that level, not my current one*. That way once I start paying a mortgage my emergency fund will still be appropriately-sized to my expenses. Once I hit **that** savings level, backfilling after my IRA-contribution withdrawal, my monthly cash savings start moving into my downpayment fund.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This means that I'm really only contributing to my downpayment fund 6-8mos/yr. Current estimate is I'm 4-5yrs from a 20%downpayment + 5% closing costs. I could get there faster if I did things differently; I don't want to.\n\nThat's my plan, YMMV. Feel free to tell me why it's dumb!"

            "text": "Not really. In most of America (to my understanding) it's a shared asset if purchased during the marriage, so at divorce it's often either sold with proceeds split down the middle or given wholly to one party with a comparable offset in other assets given to the other in compensation. It's difficult because a house is usually a very emotional asset and can be weaponized by one party trying to cause the other harm (e.g. forcing a sale when the other party wants to keep it), and there can be duelling valuations from inspectors hired by each side to support a different total division of assets, since valuing it higher or lower can benefit one party more than the other in many circumstances.\n\nThe basic point, though, is that since it's shared, it's considered equally owned by both spouses.\n\nYou can totally do an equity distribution plan, married or not, with enough legal fees to draw up a contract. The question becomes \"Why?\" very quickly. Why do you want her to have only some share of the house - you're committed enough to share major assets, but not committed enough for an equal partnership in it?\n\nIf you're not sure you're really committed for marriage, just buy it yourself. If you break up, you don't have to try to buy out her equity. If you don't, you get married and then when you sell the house the proceeds are a shared asset because they're earned during the marriage, and the next place will be joint."

To contribute to a Roth IRA above the income limits, you have to use one of the Backdoor or Mega-Backdoor methods, which may or may not be possible depending on the terms of your other accounts (I, for instance, can't do a Mega because my 401(k) plan doesn't allow post-tax contributions of any kind; HR tells me they're working on it).\n\nIt eliminates the tax benefits of the Traditional IRA, but it's still possible to use one, if a retirement-oriented account is desired for some reason. There are psychological / practical benefits for some people to having a retirement-savings account they can't easily touch for other purposes, but that's an individual choice.\n\nYou're right, though, that because Trad IRA deductions are considered income rather than capital gains, long-term retirement planning above the Roth IRA threshold are likely better done through standard taxable accounts. There's a consideration regarding dividends-management, since they'll count as income on years-issued rather than wrapped into long-term growth and collected later, but that's a personal-tax-management preference, which they should sort out with a fiduciary or tax preparer.\n\n((That deduction-loss nuance is one I often forget, as I don't have a Trad IRA))\n\nThanks for the catch!"

Neither is a good option, but what you've posted indicates there might not be one.\n\nIf you have relatively few material possessions, your best bet may be to leave town on a cheap bus ticket and start doing something, anything in a lower cost-of-living area like Albany ([roughly half the cost of New York](https://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/new-york-ny/albany-ny/15000) and only a $50-ish bus ride away). Spend a few years setting up a firm, independent financial foundation, maybe develop a skill - most importantly, find a steady job of just about any kind to pay off whatever you've got to repay the school ASAP (see if they'll let you set up a payment plan before you leave, or else get a (NOT PAYDAY) loan on the best terms a bank will give you and pay that back).\n\n&gt;If you're in physical condition for it and can pass a background check, an extreme form of this would be to enlist in the military. They're having a LOT of trouble finding recruits (missed target by like 9% last year), so they have pretty good signing bonuses for some fields (i.e. Naval Nuclear) that could help mitigate the repay-the-college thing. Some of the services will [give advanced rank](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/advanced-enlisted-rank-3332724) for completing some amount of college.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This route obviously has major lifelong consequences, but can be a valid and rewarding career path if you go into it eyes wide open. There are better subreddits for information on that, and I didn't serve myself, but one common refrain is essentially \"recruiters lie\", so do a lot of your own research if you consider this path.\n\nIf you go the homeless-in-college route, get familiar with your local food banks, find nearby churches with food or clothing assistance programs, take advantage of showers in your college's gym (if there is one - if not, try to find a cheap 24-hour fitness place and get a membership), search around for food-included events, and see if there are places on campus that you have late- or 24-hour access to to try to sleep (I know mine had some computer labs and video editing suites, with access depending on your major). Couchsurfing with friends is an option, but a) never overstay your welcome (2-3 nights at a time, once a month is a good rule) and b) be a good guest, help with chores, that sort of thing.\n\nCollege is not a necessity to succeed in life. If you can get into a skilled trade (carpentry, welding, electrical, plumbing) you can make a comparable salary to most non-professional college graduates, with half the debt or less - sometimes you can even get paid to go through trade school. If you're dead-set on a formally-educated career (engineering, medicine, law), you can come back to school later in life when you're better set for it.\n\nGood luck."

            "text": "Prime Directive suggests 15-20% for retirement. Personally I'm overshooting that, but I have low expenses relative to my salary. Without ramen-diet.\n\nIn a nutshell, annually withdrawing 4% of your retirement account's balance historically could be expected to last through a 25-30 year retirement. If you're more concerned about volatility, or want to be prepared for a longer retirement, an annual withdrawal of 3.00-3.25% can be sustained relatively indefinitely. So, to estimate how much you need saved for retirement, estimate your annual cost of living *at your desired quality of life in retirement*, then divide by either 0.04 or 0.03.\n\nSo if you currently live on $2k/mo, but think you'll want a lifestyle like you could live in your area on $4k/mo, multiply $4k by 12 (for annual expenses) and divide by your withdrawal rate. $48k/0.04 = $1.2mil, $48k/0.03=$1.6mil.\n\nHow to get to $1.6mil? Set up a spreadsheet where, going down a column, each cell equals the contents of the above multiplied by a growth rate plus a contribution. Quick mock-up assuming 7% growth (consensus on long-term S&amp;P500 return adjusted for inflation) and that your income is $70k (so 6% is $4200/yr), and that you've contributed nothing as yet, shows that at age 64 you'll have \\~$840k. ((Note that this doesn't account for raises of income)) This is below $1.2mil; it will not support $48k/yr.\n\nUsing these numbers, 8% of $70k will net $1.17mil at 64, which approximates the low-end estimate. 10% yields $1.4mil, splitting the difference. 15% yields $2.1mil, above the high-end withdrawal.\n\nIf your ratio of retirement expenses to current salary approximates 5:7 (as shown above), then your 3% contribution is too low. Upping it to 5% (8% total) is minimum; 12% (15% total) well overshoots. If you can stomach taking another few percent out of your paycheck, you'll be in a much better place. It's better to be overprepared than trying to retire on a shoestring."

So if you look at the money for time worked, the effective compensation **rate** has decreased, even though the **annual total** will increase.\n\nThey're likely trying to relate the pay to work ratio in a way that they expect you'll understand, e.g. \"how much do I get paid per hour\", when that's not really how salaried positions work. Salaried positions are \"how much do I get paid to get the job done\", and they're letting you know that the job will require about 25% more time to get the expected job done than a simple hourly position.\n\nYou can read into this that the non-managerial role you currently have has a higher time-value rate, and you would make more money *if you were able to work the same hours as expected of the manager (50).* However, as hourly you likely don't have the opportunity to get \"guaranteed overtime\", so that's not an exact equivalency. If you were to pick up 10hrs/wk at another equally-rated hourly job, you would make more money than the salary position for the same amount of work time.\n\nIn answer to your question of why anyone takes the job, there's a few things: retail tends to promote from within for management, so you can't advance your earning potential after a certain point unless you join that track; the annual total is higher, it's just not 25% higher (so your $12/hr nets $24k/yr-ish, the manager makes between $24k and $30k) to make up for the 25% extra expected working time, so there's still an increase in income; and because some people just don't want to be floor workers anymore.\n\nWhat you've run into is a classic tradeoff for hourly / salary jobs. Salary **guarantees** more, but generally has little opportunity for extra income; hourly has more **opportunity** for paid overtime, but very little security on that.

You spend $150/mo on groceries - that's remarkably low, if that's your entire food expenditure (i.e. never eat out). You're spending $500/mo with roommates, but someone who lives alone will have more than that, and someone with a family will need a larger home and have to pay for it.\n\nThird, struggle can be relative. Some people feel like they're struggling because they're stuck between a car payment or two and massive cell phone / cable bills, or are barely managing to cover the cost of a desired vacation. They could have made less expensive choices, but they decided instead to try to make the effort to live that lifestyle. Or maybe they were making more money when they made the choices and lost a job and got rehired at a lower rate, or were expecting more / better raises over time than they wound up getting, and let's completely ignore the instability of commission-based income (sales and real estate). Because of laws relating to debt repayment, they can't not make those payments - and so, they struggle to meet their obligations. \n\nThe trick is to figure out the cost of a lifestyle you want to lead, and then get a job that pays more than that (after taxes). Additionally, actively avoid lifestyle creep, and practice delayed-gratification by saving up for major purchases instead of taking on unmanageable debts. \n\nOn a career-advice front, make sure whatever you pick is something you actually like doing.

Assume your current $45k salary, since you know what that is after tax / withholdings; it's relatively unlikely a $5k larger gross salary will have a lower net so long as you're in the same metro area.\n   * Likely hidden cost: Food. Unless you're contributing to your family food budget and / or doing your own meal planning, you probably don't have a great idea what your eating habits will be on your own.\n* Do you have 3-6mos expenses of **that budget** saved for emergency use?\n* Do the numbers for a 40min-each-way commute **not** make sense for you to take the job and stay at your parents? It's *really* hard to justify moving out of somewhere you're not paying rent, if you in fact aren't, especially if you get along well with the parents. And frankly, 40min is a typical commute in a lot of places - I've got coworkers who do maybe twice that with traffic.\n* Does the new job give you additional growth potential in a professional capacity? Nicer office doesn't count - how will your professional skills improve from taking that job instead of keeping your current one? Even in the job-hopping culture that's going on right now, leaving a job under a year from starting it will raise some flags, and you'll have to explain it for a long time.\n* Have you been saving for retirement yet? If not, where's the $45k been going? If you're not already being financially responsible, it's not a given that you'll suddenly make it happen once your expenses explode.\n\nThere's shades of \"yes\" here - maybe the job has growth potential, but the numbers make sense to commute and you've not got savings / retirement going yet, so it could make sense to take the new job and drive from your parents for a year or so while you get things ready. The point I'm trying to make is that there should be preparation for the change, and reason to do so.\n\nI'll admit there's a bit of pot-calling-kettle here - 28M, I hadn't really been financially responsible in college, and instead of moving back in with parents to ease into things I moved to a state where I knew exactly one person and figured it out as I went. It took me until maybe 2 years ago to really get a handle on things. If I had another chance, I still would do some variation of this (though maybe a less-expensive area) because I don't get on well enough with my parents to've made the financial benefits worthwhile. \n\nAt the end of the day it's a personal choice. If moving out is a personal choice that you want to make, just make sure you're doing it eyes wide open.\n\nGood luck!"

There's few downsides to it, as long as you know your interest rates and can plan a couple days for transferring between institutions.\n\n&gt;Note that there is a limit to this - having a substantially large number of accounts at a substantially large number of institutions can start to set off red flags, especially if there's frequent movement between them, since that starts to look like money laundering. But three institutions with one or two accounts at each is well below that point.\n\nYour idea of getting savings with a high rate and keeping only a small amount in checking is a good one, with a few advantages.\n\n1. Your savings will come closer to keeping up with inflation, so long as the high-yield savings doesn't have maintenance fees or minimum balance / transaction requirements / penalties. I use Ally, simply because it's high-yield with no strings - some give higher rates, but they tend to have restrictions.\n2. If you Direct Deposit a set budget into your checking and beyond that into savings, it heavily disincentivizes exceeding your budget, since there's a required transfer of funds between to cover the overage. It helps impose financial discipline, since it's not just all money in the same account.\n3. If someone gets hold of the debit card or a blank check for your checking account, they'll only be able to steal the lower riding limit in that account, not your full balance. It's just a bit harder to steal money out of savings accounts; enough that someone looking for low-hanging fruit won't bother.\n\nOh, and your comment about knowing your money is safe with BoA? At $15k, you're well below the FDIC / NCUA insured limits - any credible institution will be able to keep that money safe for you.

Once I exceed the Roth threshold I'm going to be sorting through backdoors as possible and then going taxable.\n\nWhat I'm getting at with dividends is that if I hold a stock or fund in a taxable account and it pays a dividend in September, that dividend counts as income on my 2019 taxes; if I hold it in an IRA, it stays in the account (and perhaps immediately reinvested depending on plan settings) and isn't reported as income for that year, but instead taxed alongside all other funds withdrawn at retirement. It makes tax filing marginally more or less complicated, and holding it in taxable requires you to actively manage what happens with the dividends; it's not a whole lot, but there are some people who really cannot handle money well and might prefer the reinvestment and taxes be done under-the-hood in an IRA. Remember, two out of five Americans [can't pull together $400 in an emergency](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html) , so expecting active management of finances is really asking too much of hundreds of millions of people.\n\nIt's one of those things where it's not exactly the *best* decision in most circumstances, but it's not burying-silver-in-the-yard or selling-Herbalife *bad* so it's good to keep in mind that someone may decide to go with it for their own reasons."

Not a professional economist / investor, but my thought is:\n\nIn the immediate future, it *may* be a *not-terrible* idea to wait a bit, because the treasury-funds yield curve just inverted on Friday (3mo bonds have higher yield rates than 10yr bonds), which is a signal that's preceded every major recession since 1975, and this is the first time it's happened since 2007. That said, the official signal is staying inverted for...a few weeks? Or months? Again, not a professional. So this could just be a blip, or the first rats leaving the bilge. ((There are other signals of a wider global economic slowdown currently, but I just read the WSJ, I don't actually understand what the words mean. Something about Germany's industrial base, China's public- and private-debts rates, and the various central-bank rate-policy signals around the world))\n\nGiven that, it's not unreasonable to think there *may* be a recession coming sooner than later. Nobody can know if that's true, how deep it could go, or how long it could last.\n\n**However**, since you're young (I presume 35+ years until retirement?), it's extremely unlikely that mutual funds purchased at today's rate, even with a pending recession, will be worth less in 35 years.\n\nBuying today and holding until retirement is probably safe; just be prepared not to lose your head if the value drops soon - if a drop happens, it's a sign for you to put more money in while prices are down, not take it out, since you've got time for that bet to settle out.\n\nIf you were 25-30 years older, the advice would be very different. But you? I'd say go ahead and buy into the index. VTSAX is a widely-recommended fund around here (it's whole-market, not S&amp;P500)."

I don't exactly care about keeping my \"gold per turn\" positive, because that doesn't account for a LOT of things very well, but I do care about how much money I have available to spend per-day in my budget.\n\nInstead, I start with what my checking account will be at the end of the month when I settle up bills - after 401(k), after taxes, FICA, medicare, employer-provided insurance shares, **and** after automatically-deducted savings are taken out. This is what I have to spend each month on everyday cost of living, and it's always the same.\n\n((I have the amount going to checking set as a static number in my direct-deposit and all take-home pay above that go into savings, rather than a static number into savings and remainder into checking. This keeps my monthly budget exactly the same and inherently prevents lifestyle creep since the money available won't increase unless I file new paperwork with payroll))\n\nFrom there, I deduct my \"recurring monthly credit expenses\" - cell, cloud server, satellite radio, etc - as well as rent and insurance, since they're known in advance. Right now I don't pay utilities (rolled into rent), but when I do I preemptively include the highest bill from the last 12mos as the expected cost. I have no debt right now, but if I did that'd be subtracted as well. Taking all this out leaves \"Post-Expenses Budget Net\", which is the total I have available for incidentals for the month.\n\nI don't categorize everyday expenses (food, clothing, incidentals) - basically, anything that isn't so individually significant that I decide to pull from savings to cover goes in a table. It's split up by credit card so I keep the balances appropriately managed, but otherwise I don't care what was spent where, only how much was spent each day. I've got a column for the date, each credit card, and \"IsBlank\", where I test if any of the card lines were used that day. \"IsBlank\" is summed up for \"Days Remaining\", the expenses are summed up for \"Total Daily Expenses\", and subtracting TDE from PEBN and dividing by DR yields \"Daily Budget Remaining\". From there it's up to me to make sure I can live on what I have left.\n\nI think this is a lot more practical than just trying to care that each single day is positive. By keeping the long-term wealth generation vehicles out of this system, they don't seem like something that can be negotiated or changed to try to game my number above zero - they are what they need to be for my long-term goals, and this spreadsheet is for dealing with the consequences of those goals and making sure I'm living within that structure.\n\nI don't pretend it's the perfect system, but it works for me."

It's most important that you have a cushion in case of emergency medical issues or sudden unemployment. Following that I would focus on the student loan since you're already matching on your 401k and HSA. Reducing debts frees more of your income and reduces the burdens on you. You'll be in a safer place if a catastrophic event happens, and be able to do more of what you want. This is balanced against how powerful your desire for property is.\n\n\\- **What are some recommendations...** Aside from the obvious like cutting out entertainment and Netflix and the like, the biggest cost cutter would be what you're already doing: looking for a job closer to home. Judging from your bills it looks like you'd stand to save between 100 and 300 a month just from that. In the mean time, it's a good talking point for any raise talks with your current boss.\n\n\\-  **Any other tips about planning..**\n\nIt looks like you have your financial situation well in hand to be frank. You know what money is coming in, what money is going out, what is currently reliable, and what might be viable in the future without overcommiting. Some notes:\n\n\\- When your boyfriend becomes employed again he needs to start on his 401k immediately, even if his employer has a delay on matching.\n\n\\- Your boyfriend needs to start establishing his credit now, even if he plans on just being a house husband. If you're both signing for the home, both of your credits affects your mortgage.\n\n\\- If you're not estimating getting a house within the next year, I would recommend growing your credit out as well with another card or two. Between a couple well-handled credit cards and on-time loan payments your credit score, and thus mortgage interest, should be good."

If you have savings you should seriously consider paying off the full credit card balance (and continue to pay off full balance each month.)\n\nThe auto loan is likely more in the 5-8% range, and if you're almost at the end of the loan, that means the majority of your monthly payment is going to principle with very little to interest.

And we didn't visit that facility on the service date. The rep insisted the bill is valid but suggested that we should apply financial assistance. It makes sense to me. If 60% of the charge can be written off, then I shouldn't spend all the time arguing with them over the phone. But what about negative consequences I don't know about?\n\nAny advice is highly appreciated!"

Here is the update:\n\nI made about 15 calls to both the insurance and provider in the last 3 days. The response from insurance was \"the balance on your EOB is your responsibility, don't pay anything beyond that\". The response from provider is \"we billed you since your insurance didn't pay the full amount.\" The provider denied that it used the wrong diagnosis code and claimed insurance confirmed the procedure is not covered when it called insurance. However, I checked with my insurance before the procedure. And I retained the email from my insurance which says the procedure is covered.\n\nFinally, I got lucky. An experienced insurance rep agreed to call the provider. The provider used the wrong diagnosis code and agreed to resubmit the claim. It will take about 30 days to reprocess. I pray this issue is resolved.\n\nRecap:\n\nMy wife had Amniocentesis at an in network provider. The provider submitted doctor's charge, ultrasound and facility charge separately. Insurance processed doctor's charge and ultrasound charge. But it applied a full \"insurance discount\" to the facility charge. My EOB shows my responsibility is $36. The provider billed me $1286 wanting me to pay \"insurance discount\" of $1,250.\n\nBefore my wife got pregnant, I never used my healthcare much and was satisfied with it. Now I realized the healthcare billing system is so abusive. Almost every bill I got contains some errors. It is really stressful and frustrating. And some of the billing errors are simple mistakes. For instance, the provider submit an OB bill to the insurance using Husband's name as patient multiple times. I want to know if there is any nonprofit organization in central Ohio fighting this outrageous billing practice. I want to volunteer for such organizations. If there is none, should we get together to create one?"

In November 2018, my wife found she was pregnant and we went to her OB. OB ordered more than 15 different tests from the hospital's lab totaling more than $3500. One of those is carrier screen costing us $540. On January 4 2019, we went to the Maternal Fetal Medicine in the same hospital system. We only wanted to do a Amniocentesis. But we had to see a genetic counselor first. (They wouldn't see us when we tried only book for the Amnio). She recommended several blood tests. And we just want to get through her quickly to do the Amnio. We chose the cheapest one. Guess what? She sold us another carrier screen test. Fortunately, this is from an out of system vendor only costing $199 per person. $340 cheaper than the one done in the hospital system. However, we don't need another test when the first one is negative.\n\nI admit I should had examined the test more carefully. But the hospital never sent us the itemized bill. I will never discovered it if I had not been fighting them for balance billing. And the counselor is supposed to go through my wife's pregnancy history before recommending the test to us.\n\nAny advice is highly appreciated!"

Now the corrected EOB says \"Hospital Outpatient\" not \"Nursing home\". That's after 17 phone calls and messages. 5 hours spent. And the hospital billing side has not corrected its bill yet. I think I should send the hospital a bill reflecting my hours spent. One more thing, the hospital submitted total charges of $1601. Only $173.13 are allowed. Their bills are inflated to a fraudulent level.\n\nI am still waiting for the provider changing its bills. "

It\u2019s also possible the policy pays out dividends. Those dividends can be used to pay the interest. Furthermore, many people use whole life insurance policies to get retirement income. They take out loans and just never pay them back. As long as the Loan and interest doesn\u2019t accrue greater than the cash value, when the insured dies then the outstanding loan and interest is deducted from the death benefit. \n\nEdit: I\u2019ll also note that policy loans have no impact to your credit, whether you pay it back or not\n\nEdit 2: here\u2019s some more useful info from investopedia to help calm your nerves a bit.

A $1M policy sold originally when he was 45 and healthy, the premiums could be around $20k a year. If he got it when he was older it would cost more. So I doubt he has a policy that large if he only has 85k in premium and even if he did, 90k per year may still not be sustainable. Perhaps ask to see some of the projections the advisor gave him. \n\nEdit: I should also point out that I\u2019m like 95% sure if it does lapse he\u2019d only have to pay taxes on the amount over the premium put into the policy - in this case $5,000.

            "text": "Okay let\u2019s see if I can answer some of these..\n1) APR is the \u201cannual percentage rate\u201d. Let\u2019s say your APR is 25% and credit card bill is $100 and don\u2019t pay it at all, in a year you\u2019ll now owe $125. This interest is extremely high, think how something as risky as the stock market only returns 7% on average. Fairly rarely it will return 25% in a single year. \nFor the second part of the question, paying in full each month will over time increase your credit because it shows that your trustworthy and pay your debts on time. I highly recommend the idea that you never spend more than you can afford (ie pay off your credit card bill in full every month, don\u2019t spend more than you can afford!). If you just keep paying the minimum, your score will stay the same but your debt will be growing at that ridiculous rate I mentioned before. PLUS, your minimum will continue to grow, increasing your utilization. \n\n2) in this specific instance, a lot of dealers don\u2019t allow you to pay more than just a certain amount on a credit card (I think when I bought mine I could only use $1,000). Secondly, spending 5,000 and paying it off that month is no different than spending $50 and paying it off. Another thing to note for large purchases with credit cards, occasionally they\u2019ll charge the 3% fee which would outweigh the percentage back you get in rewards, not worth it. To your questions about utilization, I pay off my credit cards at least once a week through my online banking apps. This is mostly so I see the money actually leaving my bank account as the month progresses and this is a personal preference. There is the benefit that it does decrease my utilization since the balance that hits my monthly statement is say $300 instead of $1,200 for an example. I don\u2019t really care about that because credit utilization doesn\u2019t have a memory on the credit report. \n\n3) find out your credit score from credit karma, if you have no credit, perhaps consider a secured card or a beginner card. When you get approved, use it for small purchases at first to keep things under control and most importantly, PAY IT IN FULL EVERY MONTH. \n\n4) just start with one card for right now. When you find out your credit score you can use a source like nerd wallet to filter cards and find what might be the best for you. They have good explanations of the different types of cards. I recommend just one card because at this point you probably won\u2019t get approved for a card that has many good benefits (while I\u2019m thinking about it, avoid any cards with an annual fee for now). I say just one card because average age of credit is a very important category determining your credit score. In a few years maybe you get another card with good benefits in which case you\u2019d have to manage keeping three cards open. If you only open one right now, at that time you\u2019d only have to concern yourself with keeping two cards open. \n\nAnyways, hope I didn\u2019t get too confusing, let me know if you have any other questions or confusion about whatever I said.

Seems like most counties also send out the Protest Form along with the value notice.  Most counties also have an Online Protest form that you can submit by using information from the Notice of Appraised Value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can protest the value yourself, or hire a property tax attorney.  Most of the time, if you don't know who will be doing your protest, you can submit another form at a later date to designate someone else if you choose to not do it yourself.\n\nI always protested myself, but my in-laws often used Property Tax Attorneys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I lived near Houston, I did it myself and had good success using [Jubally](https://jubally.com/) to pull the data for me and create a report.  Once they have all the data from the county, you can enter your address to get Jubally's calculation of the value of your home.  In my experience, whatever value Jubally showed, they had data to back up that proposed value once I purchased the report.   Jubally says if the report can't get your value lowered, they will buy the report back from you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are friends with a realtor, you might be able to get them to run a comp on your house.  Keep in mind that these comps and CMA method listed later typically are houses that have been recently updated, painted, renovated, etc.   Whereas your current house may not, and may be in need of repairs.  You can get contractor estimates for the repairs and updates needed to later present with your protest to help lower your value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPer the state, there are 2 methods for calculation your appraised value: the Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) method and the Uniform and Equal (U&amp;E) method.    Whenever I used Jubally, they calculated and presented both analysis methods to me.   U&amp;E method typically show the lower value most often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you file your protest, most ppl seem to recommend to select both\" Value is over Market\" &amp; the \"Value is unequal compared with other properties\" options, and say you will present your information at your hearing along with your opinion of value.  Most seem to recommend to wait till the hearing to present your proposed value, and to not use the \"Online Settle / iSettle\" option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you file your protest, both counties I have protested in had to show me what properties they are using for their analysis.  &lt;-- This is very helpful for you.  \n\nYou can see differences in the properties the county picked vs your report.  You can lookup the houses on Zillow or realestate websites and often still get the pics to see how the house has been updated compared to yours.  You can take those pics and pics of your un-updated house, and print them out and bring them with your to your protest hearing to justify your value.\n\nThe last time I protested with HCAD, I noticed that the comps HCAD used for the U&amp;E method had an average of 7 years turnover (between sales), whereas the Jubally report had comps with an average of 15 years turnover.  This meant that the homes HCAD had picked were being brought up to current market value much more often resulting in higher values that my home was compared against.   After pointing that out, the HCAD Appraiser accepted the value listed in my Jubally report.  My home value was lowered $25k which was around a 13% reduction compared to the initial HCAD value!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes you get a good County Appraiser that will really work with you at your informal protest hearing, and sometime you will get ones that are a huge dick.  So some years may be better than others.  That's why I protest every year.\n\nI also stated write the Appraiser's names down in-case I can fill out a survey or try and request the good ones the following year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, there is a lot you can do to lower your taxes with protesting.  Jubally's [FAQ](https://jubally.com/faqs#) page has lots of good info if you have other questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have nothing to lose but your time by filing the protest, but everything to gain if the county lowers your value\n\nAgain, if you live in a county that Jubally serves I highly recommend using them, and have had good luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you got any other questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

Get that down and I bet your credit score will go up again. Mine just jumped almost 30 points because for whatever reason, my credit card company on the only card I have any debt on and am actively (and aggressively) paying it off just upped my credit limit therefore lowering my credit ratio which raised my credit score because now I was under 30%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUse a new car as a reward.

Excellent credit.\nCurrent salary is $58K. I can save a about $1,500 a month, $18,000 per annum. Living expenses roughly$22K.\nAssets: 1.) Cash on hand, $65K  2.) $20k in a sweep account.  3.) $10K divided among 3 ETFs brokered by a \"too big to fail\" bank -- all growth stocks.  4.) $12K in an orphaned retirement account all growth stocks cannot contribute to 5.)

Vanguard IRA Roth $4,500 70/30 stocks bonds 8.) $5,800 current retirement account Franklin Temp that work contributes max to.  All in all, it's 95,000 in retirement accounts, roughly 85% stocks, which feels too risky for much longer.  Another $10K in a taxed account.  And some cash to use for something.\n\nMy plan for 2019: 1. contribute $7,000 to the Vanguard IRA, and each year thereafter. It has 70/30 allocation which feels good at this stage. 2. Re-allocate the retirement accounts to include bonds. 3. invest $20K in a taxed balanced mfund, like Vanguard.  4. Better income job. 5. consider moving to a cheap country.

[Here's the information I provided them](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/akzoo2/stop_blaming_your_spouse_or_your_second_job_for/efcuiwn). \n\nAs for your unimportant question, the IRS seems to think that everyone reads the tiny details of their instructions and that their forms are straight-forward. In the fine print, it does say that \"only one person should fill out one for Married Filing Jointly\", but of course, in practice, maybe 1 in 20 people actually read the instructions. "

            "text": "&gt;Approx $4000 in expenses, but plan on having my house paid off by then. \n\nFor sake of simplicity, we'll assume that you'll continue to use $4,000 per month in retirement. Even though you won't have housing expenses, you'll likely to see an increase in medical expenses (premiums, co-pays, prescription medicine, etc.) which will more than offset this cost. This will also assume that you're planning on maintaining your current lifestyle in retirement. \n\nBearing this in mind, and assuming a 4% withdrawal rate, you would need to have $1.2 million saved for retirement by Age 60 in order to achieve that level of retirement. Assuming a 5% rate of return on your portfolio, you would need to save $16,230 per year in addition to your current balance in order to get to $1.2 million by the time you reach age 60. \n\nOf course, this number comes with a number of caveats including, but not limited to:\n\n1. A 5% rate of return on assets, while historically consistent, is not necessarily indicative of future returns. Asset values are generally higher than they've been over the course of history which may reduce future returns. This would necessitate additional saving.\n2. A 4% withdrawal rate may not last for your entire retirement. This may necessitate additional assets at retirement, which would be achieved by additional saving. \n3. This does not consider the effect of Social Security, which may reduce the extent that retirement savings that you would need, assuming that you qualify, and it still exists.\n4. This does not consider the houses that you expect to inherit and any income or funds from sale in the calculation. The timing, amount, and existence of this amount is questionable and generally out of your control, so it's best ignored for purposes of the analysis.\n5. This analysis does not consider taxes. Based on the characterization of the $250K that you currently have saved, and future actions of Congress, which cannot be predicted, your taxes may be higher or lower in retirement than they are now, which would necessitate more or less saving, respectively. Additionally, if a substantial portion of your $250K is in Traditional Accounts, your lack of tax diversity may preclude you from realizing significant tax savings in retirement. This would necessitate additional saving. \n6. This doesn't consider the incremental needs that you will have as you progress through life (kids going to college, etc.). This may impact your ability to save for retirement.\n\nObviously, there are a lot of moving parts here. The $16,230 per year I noted above is not a hard and fast number - it could be a lot more than that, it could even be less than that. The biggest takeaway is that you need to save, and I would recommend that amount to be your baseline. You know your situation better than we do, so leverage retirement calculators on the internet, which could be helpful in giving you an idea of how much and to what extent you need to save. \n\nInformation on tax-advantaged vehicles that you can use for saving (401k, IRA, HSA, etc.) can be found in the sidebar. It is generally recommended that you leverage them as much as possible. \n\nHope this helps!"

Additionally, you are allowed to make [Substantially Equal Periodic Payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantially_equal_periodic_payments) under IRC Section 72(t) which allows you to withdraw from your retirement account prior to reaching age 59.5.\n\n&gt; Maybe its worth contributing until I have $10,000 to withdraw for a first home? I also read that is a qualified withdrawal. \n\nThe exception that you're noting allows you to take $10,000 in earnings from your Roth IRA to purchase a first home. This is different from just the balance of the account.\n\nFor example, if you make $50,000 in contributions and have a balance of $70,000 in your Roth IRA, you'd be able to take out $50,000 at any time, without penalty, or $60,000 toward the purchase of your first home. \n\n&gt; We will be getting a 401k program in 2019 and I'm wondering if I should shift all my contributions there. \n\nI wouldn't shift all of your contributions to a 401(k) as these plans have less flexibility and offer fewer (and worse) fund options than Roth IRA's. With that said, any match that you get on your 401(k) plan is free money and it's good to maintain tax diversity in your retirement portfolio for when the time comes. "

However, since my spouse and I are only registered domestic partners, and not married, my insurance costs are split:\n\nEmployee +children rate is pre tax, and the difference between the +children and +spouse and children rates are taken out post-tax.\n\nIts early in the year but I'm on track to contribute enough money into my HSA, with pretaxed dollars, to max out my contribution limit (I think it's ~$6900)\n\nWe are expecting our third child this August, and the quote I have for her obstetrician (I think that's the right term lol) care is about $2500, but that doesn't include hospital charges. \n\nMy plan is to pay all hospital bills using credit cards with the best reward payout, and reimburse myself through my hsa.\n\nWill this cause any tax related problems for me if I reimburse myself for my spouses expenses?\n\nFor what it's worth, I'll be making payments in the $350-$400 range, so it's maybe less risky than doing this all at once. If there's an issue, do you think I can count on finding out about it within a month or two of my first reimbursement?  I've never used to reimburse yourself feature before, and my hsa is through HSABANK (in case that makes a difference)."

If you want to offer three different rents, for example because the three bedrooms in the house are different sizes, that's fine too.\n\nIt would certainly be fair of you to pay the same amount of mortgage as your roommate, because you're equal owners of the house / company.

I only found a job after six months despite running myself to the ground applying and that\u2019s only because the mom of the one person I knew in the city had a job opening where she worked. \n\nIt was an office job, minimum wage, and they wanted me to kiss their feet after giving me $1 raise after three months. I excelled at the job and their productivity soared, but the job ate at me. I wanted to do software development so badly, but the toxic soul sucking job, adjusting to a new country, emotionally, mentally, physically, living with an emotionally abusive family, and figuring out how to fit in a first world country\u2019s software development field coming from third world was so much toll on my mind. \n\nThen opportunity came, and luck definitely played a part. Through another incredibly kind connection. They were looking for a junior software developer. I grabbed it instantly. I sent my resume in. The person who wanted to refer me said it was ugly as fuck. He said try it again one more time. I took the criticism in stride, actually grateful, and even paid for a resume builder thing online to properly layout my information. My confidence at this point was shot with everything going on in my life. It was so dark. I was crying at my desk. But I got it. I sold myself hard during the phone interview involving all senior developers and CEO and pushed through. I was even in a car accident (I was a passenger) two days before my in person interview but I kept going. \n\nThis is where my mistake comes. Without properly researching market average salary, or seeing what was offered for similar titles, I threw a number so low. A number that basically reflected how much I was willing to take just to escape. Average market salary in my area was 85k. I asked for 35k-45k. They gave me 45k and I couldn\u2019t even believe it at the time. \n\nA salary increase was assured once I passed probation, and it did happen. I got bumped up to 50k. 5k is huge. But I can\u2019t stop beating myself up. People the same age as me with absolutely no experience like I did are starting at 65-70k. I felt even more stupid when I remembered the person who referred me to this job said \u201cOh I even know someone who they offered 60k to despite no experience\u201d. I keep thinking what if I just said 50k-60k instead. \n\nI know. I can find another job, or wait for the yearly review, but I would actually like to keep this one. Sure there are other cons I have not mentioned (vacation days are poor, I missed four days of pay in December because they shut down and I didn\u2019t have PTO) but I have an incredibly kind and generous boss that makes work very fulfilling, and sometimes that\u2019s worth giving up +5k-10k a year. \n\nYet somehow I cannot forget the memory of putting in a number that clearly showed how desperate and insecure I was, and how a little bit of confidence would\u2019ve made a world of difference.

Writing it out has been helpful though. \n\nActually outside of salary issues I wouldn\u2019t mind staying a good 3-4 years. It is valuable experience, I enjoy the work. I probably have some growth to do within the company if I do well enough. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mention this but I was able to leave my family, as this was a good distance away.

We are doing this opposite-snowball effect approach, so what we\u2019ve been doing is saving every penny after monthly bills to throw at a large collection debt ($7k), while still making early/on time minimum payments on all other debts (car payments &amp; credit cards).\nHowever, once we have the full $7k saved by April, we will then be able to start increasing all of the payments and even doubling them on our other smaller debts. After recently checking my credit reports on credit karma I noticed I was pre-approved for a loan offer of the exact amount of my total credit card balances. Here are the credit card balances, as well as the loan offer:\n\nCredit cards:\n\nPNC Core: balance $1971/min monthly pymt $55/Annual APR 21.24%\n\nValue City Furniture: balance $1228/min monthly pymt $44/APR 29.99%\n\nCitibank: balance $1020/min monthly $27/APR 21.24%\n\nChase: balance $990/min monthly $31/APR 25.24%\n\nGoodyear: balance $831/min monthly $32/APR 30.74%\n\n\nStarting in April, I can pay $100/month to each of these cards, or two $50 payments (if this would make a difference?) In total I\u2019d be throwing $500/month at my credit lines and they\u2019d be paid down at approximately the end of 2020, or beginning of 2021. I could probably increase that payment a bit, but we also wanted to finally put money aside for an emergency savings, as well as increase our car payments, so I thought $100 on each card was a decent monthly payment.\n\nThe loan I was offered:\n\n\nLoan: $6040\n\nMin monthly payment $224/mo for 36 months\n\nAPR estimates 19.95%\n\nInterest and fees $2035\n\n\nNow while this monthly loan payment is lower, I could double that each month and pay it sooner, thus paying less in interest. I\u2019m very very hesitant about taking out any loans, as clearly I\u2019m on a mission to pay down all of our existing debt by cash, and I\u2019m unsure and too inexperienced with loans to know which option would be the best for me.

MD is expensive, but unfortunately, I'd say it's pretty accurate if you currently have \"0\" withholding. This also means, however, that your tax return will be higher. A few people already recommended it but I can't stress enough how it helped me since I knew next to nothing about this myself, check out the IRS withholding calculator. I recommend using the **Turbo Tax** one on their website (it's free) because it walks you through every step and uses layman's terms. I adjusted my W-4 from \"0\" to \"2\" allowances, so they take a little less out of my check each pay period. However, this means I will receive much less money in my tax return next tax season, which I personally am fine with. But be careful, above a certain number of allowances (again Turbo Tax calculator will show you with a sliding scale between 0-9) and you will end up owing money next tax season (meaning my employer did not take all of the required taxes out of my income for that year). Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It all comes down to preference. But if you owe over a certain amount ($1000, I think) they can \"penalize\" that and add a fine. Good luck, friend!"

I hate their fees.\n\nNo employer HSA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My attempt to avoid 401K:**\n\nOpen and fund IRA  with Vanguard - $6000 deductible\n\nPay Student Loan Interest - $2500 deductible\n\nThat leaves me with $13,800 that needs to be sheltered from taxable income.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I know that only $22,300 will be taxed at 22% but will that same amount be taxed at 22% at retirement?\n\nEdit:  12K standard deductible in addition to IRA &amp; interest deductible eliminate my concern.

In the short term, however, you need a vehicle of your own and it doesn't need to be anything but reliable while you start getting caught up.\n\nWhile paying the minimums on your loans, I would prioritize a small emergency fund (~$1k), save for a car, pay off the credit card, and then work on the student loan. You could consider beefing up the emergency fund a bit after the credit card is paid off in order to give you a bit more security while paying down the larger loan.\n\nAs far as retirement savings, I would get the small emergency fund and the car purchase out of the way as fast as possible.  Your lack of those things really is just tempting fate.  All it takes is a breakup or a small emergency to start your finances going in the wrong direction. \n\nAfter those two things are squared away, I would probably only invest in the company 401K up to the match until the credit card was paid off and I had a better emergency fund.  Once you are comfortably sitting on a solid emergency fund and no debts except for your student loans, then you could look into doing some more retirement investing.

But, at the end of the day, you are choosing to prioritize an expensive phone upgrade over paying down your debts.  \n\nFrom a purely financial and numbers standpoint, I would recommend that you buy something less expensive and only after it becomes necessary to upgrade.  From a life perspective, I don't have a problem with it as long as you don't make this sort of decision a habit in all aspects of life.

If not, then this is a bad habit to get into.\n\nIt is easy to justify eating out, a vacation, a newer car, a top of the line phone, etc in the microcosm of that single purchase.  However, that behavior in a macrocosm is what leads people into pretty bad financial situations.  You know you, and you know your situation and behavior better than anyone here, so you will have to make a value judgement as to whether or not this particular phone is worth splurging on.\n\n\nAs an aside, you sound pretty responsible and thoughtful.  I do wonder if you asked the question because you knew it was not the \"most responsible\" thing to do.  This advice is as much for the average person that may read it later as it is for you.

In buying or selling a home the home buyer's or home seller's perception as to value can make or break how negotiating a deal goes.  If a broker shows someone a house that is at their number, it is natural for a potential buyer to go from house to house to house looking for every expectation to be met.  If the broker starts you at the house that checks all your boxes, but is $100k more than you were planning on, you might be more agreeable to giving up on some of your must-haves.  We all want the perfect house, in the perfect neighborhood, with all of the right rooms and features.  Often our dream house may be out of reach of our budget and the broker wants to perform a reality check quickly, rather than after the 25th house they have brought you to see.\n\n\nSame goes for selling.  The broker will often set a low expectation on price, because it is easier to close when the buyer is thrilled to be getting more than they expected.\n\n\nThe common belief is that the broker is pushing to grow the number and increase their commission.  An experienced broker wants to close - quickly and often.  They are not fighting for an extra $10-20k in the gross price.  They rather have a smaller commission after two weeks and move on to the next sale, than have to service someone's endless inquiries and calls and visits for 3 months for an extra $1,000.  They will make more turning over sales rapidly. ($50k at 4%, will likely be less than $500 more to the broker - they might be splitting with another broker and the agency gets a large piece, sometimes leaving the agent as little as 15% of the total commission) "

I switched jobs about 2 years ago (was at VA so had a TSP) and in my current job I have 2 accounts. One is only my contributions, which is $9750/yr. The other is from my university and this fluctuates from year to year...probably about 9-12k yearly. Both accounts are through Fidelity and set up on 2045 R6. Bit of a background, I was in college/grad school/residency/fellowship until 2013 when I was 31 years old (now 36) so I am late to the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm essentially trying to understand the singular or combined effects of market growth and dividends. I noticed over the past 2 years that dividends paid into each of my Fidelity accounts at 4.926% at the end of the calendar year. This amount was reinvested. TSP does not show any dividends (that I can find anyway).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAssuming an average of 6% yearly gain on investment growth over the course of these accounts, is it (somewhat) safe/reasonable to assume that I can expect this gain plus reinvested dividends yearly? So 10-11% compounded ROI yearly between the two? This would be independent of monthly contributions. This seems too good to be true, so I'm sure it's not. Could someone help me understand if I am correct with this assumption and ELI5 if it's not? Also, regarding dividends, do these remain stable yearly? They were the same percentage in 2017 and 2018. If they don't stay the same each year, is there any rhyme or reason for how they change yearly? Or just depends on investments and market? Does anyone out there know if TSP works with dividends as well?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks all!"

I have a 403B and a 401A account through my university.

(1) University contributes 9% of professorship salary, so $5850/yr. (2) After I top 40k collections, my university then contributes an additional 9% to collections. This ranges from 4k-5k/yr.

I have come across two that I've been looking into, FSKAX and FSCSX. I have several retirement accounts through Fidelity but am otherwise fairly new to the personal investing scene. In comparing these two funds, FSCSX seems to have a bit better long-term growth record (I know that past doesn't predict future here) but has a higher expense ratio (0.73% vs 0.015%), higher turnover rate (28% vs 5%), and slightly higher volatility and risk. My understanding is that the higher expense ratio would eat away at some growth through fees and that a higher turnover rate could generate some capital gains taxation. It would likely be the case that the initial entry to the fund would be around 500-1000 with about a 100 or so put in each month going forward.\n\nIn this context, are these fees and turnover rates really something to consider heavily when deciding between the two here? Or are they largely negligible differences with the amount I'll be putting in and potential growth trajectory?\n\nAlso, does anyone out there have any pros/cons for each of these funds?"

For the safest option I'd put that money in a high interest savings account like Ally or CIT or a CD account.\n- I would personally start an HSA account if my workplace offered it.\n- I would consider maxing out the 403b but he's worried about large costs and having money tied up in retirement. To do so, I would set contributions to max out and use current savings to make up the difference if it exists.\n\nI know he doesn't have any large purchases but is very insecure of not having immediate cash available (hence why he had up to $60k sitting in a checkings account at one point on a $50k/year salary).\n\nIn conclusion, he's got $30k sitting all in bonds, he's worried about depreciation of those bonds, but he also wants to be safe and let his money grow more than inflation.

As I understand it, the typical rule of thumb is 100-age, currently that means I should be investing about 30% bonds and 70% stocks (via funds and ETFs), but since I came later to this game, with everything else being safely allocated, I'm planning to invest more aggressively and be closer to 85/15 (still exercising diversification) with the remaining amount since I'm not planning on any large purchases for the next few years.\n\nOutside of that, I have a mortgage, but no loans. So it seems I can still live a comfortable, frugal life, and even  save towards an annual vacation budget.\n\nEdit:: also, I was super scared to mess everything up with a mouse click, so I explained every action I was taking here and someone walked me through it here.\n\nEdit2:: my understanding in the order of operation:\n1) establish emergency fund and out into a high-interest account (which you are)\n2) contribute up to employer match on 401k\n3) max out Roth IRA for 2018 &amp; 2019\n4) max out HSA if you can\n5) finally go back to maxing out 401k\n6) tell me when you find out what to do next...."

Finally, it's not like you sell off all your stocks at the very bottom and just never re-invest.\n\nAlso there's signs when the economy is going to go south. 2008 didn't happen overnight. There were signs in 2007 already with the market slowing, and when people talk about 50% loss, it's referring to the very bottom in early 2009 versus the market highs in late 2007.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that you should probably adjust your savings depending on how well that market is doing and how risk averse you are. Let's rewind to September 2008. Market crashed starting late September/October 2008. It doesn't mean you get fired day 1, and even if you do, the market hasn't tanked all that much. Selling off assets isn't a big deal. But say you don't get laid off Day 1, but given the situation looks dire, maybe it would make sense at that point to start building up cash savings instead of siphoning off $2k a month to your brokerage account, keep it in cash. By the time you get laid off in December, you might have $6k built up for instance. And even by then the market hasn't bottomed out, so you sell off $20k to help fund your expenses while you job hunt. If we tell people not time the market to invest their savings. then shouldn't the opposite hold true when you sell?\n\nHonestly it comes down to what your job is and your financial situation. I make a decent amount in tech so it's not like I can't build up my emergency savings quickly.

I have means to get that down to about $10 - $15k before my payments begin in January of 2020. My girlfriend and I are going to be moving to a nearby city and will be paying anywhere between $1,300 &amp; $1,700 for rent. She will be graduating in May as well with about the same amount of loans as I have. She unfortunately does not have any means to bring that amount down before payments begin and still has to do a Masters degree. Also, about half of her loans are private and have a 6 - 7% interest rate. I am getting really worried about her loans and how much I should help her. She will begin substitute teaching hopefully while doing her Masters and maybe some tutoring if possible. I don't think she will make any more than $25-30k a year until she becomes a full time teacher. I will be making $70k gross. Using some online estimated payment calculators, almost all of her income will be going towards her student loan payments which really concerns me. What are your recommendations for tackling her student loans? I assume I will have to foot our rent, groceries, utilities, etc until she gets out from under her loans a bit. Should I be as worried as I am? Also, If I do have residual income and a emergency savings and whatnot, should I help her with her payments? The amount of interest alone that she would pay by making minimum payments I feel would really impede any future plans of maybe one day getting a house or things like that.

It's not as effective if your card gives other benefit than just the 0% APR. For example, if your card also give 2% cash back and 0% APR, if you take advantage of the 0% APR, then you can't really take the 2% cashback since you will quickly fill the card limit and then end up not being able to churn money through the card (build balance, pay off balance, repeat) to get that 2% cash back. \n2. The return isn't that good. I assume your strat is instead of paying the card, you just invest the cash. The rate of return of even a 20k limit for a full year is probably at 6% in stock market or $1,200. But you only get that if you have an expense that would have cost you 20k anyway, and you put that on the card to defer the expense. In effect, you have an opportunity gains of 6%. So this is like a saving account starting at 20k and gain 6% for the year! However, if you don't have a big purchase, and slowly building this 20k via normal expense, your opportunity gain diminish. The gains would be similar to having a 6% saving account starting from zero, about half the gain.  \n\nSo long story short:\n\n1. Zero APR card is only effective if you have a huge expense coming up and would like to defer the expense and have an opportunity gain. \n2. If you go with a zero APR card, then go for a card that a) has the longest period (18-24 months) and or b) very high limit so you can borrow as long as you can, as much as you can. Ignore other features since you cannot take advantage of anyway. \n\nIf you don't have a big expense, I wouldn't bother with it. \n\nGood luck."

This is important.\n\nWhen you look at houses, they call it an investment but it is not the same as investing in the stock market. A house alone, especially a primary residence, is objectively a significantly disadvantaged investment as an asset class for several reasons:\n\n1. A house is the only asset class where the acquisition and liquidation costs (i.e. closing costs) are significant. Buying and selling stock costs you $9, buying a house costs you 3%-10% of asset value.\n2. A house cost to own is significant (i.e. maintenance). Maintenance of 1% of the total value (not equity) is like buying stock with 4%-10% management fee. \n\nJust these two alone makes it inferior as an investment when better alternatives exists such as REIT where neither disadvantages mentioned above exists. This is why we never buy an empty house and leave it vacant (except for the Chinese where there are literally no other alternative so they buy a house and leave it vacant).\n\nSo if you purely wants to diversify, do something else.\n\nNow, let's turn the questions a bit differently. Can a house be a good investment? There are two cases when they are:\n\n1. The asset is revenue generating with a positive rate of return (i.e. rental property or a property that appreciate via local market or forced appreciation via \"flipping\").\n2. It serves a purpose to full fill a need for your life where alternatives to fullfill this need is more expensive (we are talking about opportunity costs here). In this sense, it would be the same as \"is this mac computer a good investment?\", the answer in this case depends on the person and its role in that person's life.\n\nFor case #1, I don't expect that would be you unless you are planning to be a landlord or house flipping so that's out. What you are left with is a big bet that your local rental markets returns well. That's a bet you can make. But it's risk profile is so different, you can't really predict. \n\nFor case #2, the mindset is different. If you are just watching youtube, then a mac is a terrible investment; a small tablet might serve you better. But if you are a professional photographer needing some pretty accurate color on your computer for work, then hell yea, that's the best investment in your arsenal.\n\nSee how's there a bit of a difference here? There is already a need for the asset as a utility, and this utility makes the asset a good investment. In other words, if you need a house, then a house can be a good investment compared to the other alternative of living (you always gotta live somewhere). But if you don't need a house, a house is not going to be a good investment for you since you have no utility for the house (and also a terrible asset class).\n\nSo buy a house when you need a house, like buying a computer when you need a computer. But don't buy to diversify (that's like saying buy a mac computer and hold it for the value). It's not really an asset class that is comparable to stock and bonds and therefore should not be considered as a mean to \"diversify\" portfolio.\n\nThere are other perspective on using real estate to get access to tax deductions, generate revenue, and access to leverage to get appreciation. However, all of those things comes after you have decided that you indeed need and or want a house. If you don't need or want one, those advantages cannot offset the disadvantages listed (at least at the current climate where alternative exists)"

You understand the mechanics of communal living and this is a great advantage and skill. Many people cannot swallow or comprehend how they can live in someone else's house in harmony. \n\nFrom my personal experience, renting another room in someone else house is a great way to save money (I have done so for 5 years and saved a ton, and just bought a house on that saving). Home owner often will not push for higher rent since their mortgage are cheaper than apartment operating cost. Often, they are just happy to have a great renter and person to live in the house. I'll say, some home owner give me deep discount to get me to live in their house since I'm a good renter and roommate. \n\nIf, and this a big if, you are only considering buying a house just to manage monthly payment, you are far better off renting a room in a house. You enjoy (1) the flexibility of renting and (2) the lower payment of a house that most home owner is able to pass to you via lower rent compared to apartment. \n\nIf a house payment of $900 (not including repair or initial closing cose) while rent apartment in the area is $850, you are better off renting. And I bet you someone will be happy to rent out a room for $400-$500 in your area. \n\nLastly, an apartment with a roommate is a good option as well. \n\nI would heed other's advice on saving a bit more to pay off your car, improve your credit score, and save more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;"

            "text": "Many items are negotiable when you are shopping for a mortgage.   There are two basic categories related to Closing Costs:  prepaid finance charges and pass through fees. Prepaid finances charges are generally the fees that can be negotiated while pass through fees services are fees for items that the lender must order from a third-party and for which the costs are passed through to the borrower at closing. Pass through fees are not generally negotiable with one major exception being fees charged for Title and Settlement Services. By law, those products are services are fees that you as the consumer can shop for in order to find a lower cost.  The lender likely has a preferred service provider for title and settlement services, but you may want to check with other title companies in your area to search for lower costs.  The most common items that you cannot shop for are the fee charged by property appraiser to provide an opinion of value on your home, the fee charged to the lender to access your credit report, and any government fees assessed for recording legal documents or taxes assessed for transferring ownership of a property.  Outside of the pass-through fees, you can and should attempt to negotiate the prepaid finance charges with the lenders you contact about your loan. Items such as Origination Fees, Processing Fees, Underwriting Fees, and absolutely the interest rate are all negotiable.\n\nAfter making an application with a lender, the lender is required to provide you a written document known as the Loan Estimate within three days. This document is universal in format between all lenders (as required by federal law) and should allow you to look at an \"apples to apples\" comparison of the various rates and fees that you may be offered.  \n\nChoosing to finance your closing costs into your loan amount is generally a convenience preferred by consumers when they refinance their home, but you are absolutely correct in that it increases the interest paid on the loan.  If you are in a financial position to pay your closing costs out of pocket; then it will be a smarter financial decision.\n\nThe topic of paying discount points for a lower rate is a little bit more complicated.   Consumers that intend to keep the loan for the entire term and continue to own the property for twenty or thirty years will benefit more from buying down the interest rate.   Consider a $100,000 loan amount in which you agree to pay a 4.25% fixed interest rate for a thirty-year repayment term.   The total interest paid on this loan, assuming that you do not make any extra payments, would be approximately $77,000.  The same loan amount and term at 4.000% would cost approximately $71,870 in interest.   The decrease in interest costs over the life of the loan is over $5000.   Assuming you paid a 1% discount point of $1000, you have saved $4000 over the life of the loan.  However; if you refinance the loan or sell the property before it matures, you would realize less savings and the cost upfront may be less beneficial.   Consider accessing a free amortization calculator online and run the different scenarios you are considering to compare actual savings versus actual costs to determine if the upfront cost meets your savings goal.  There are many available online and most are very user friendly allowing you to input a loan amount, interest rate and term to determine the annual and life of loan interest costs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;"

            "text": "There is really no advantage or disadvantage to the timing of opening a new card after you open a mortgage.   It is not advisable to open any new accounts while you are in the middle of the mortgage approval process.   Mortgage lenders are generally required to certify all of the debt you owe at the time your loan closes and have various approaches to monitoring changes to your credit report during the mortgage underwriting process.   Opening a new account before you close on a mortgage will likely require the lender to request additional paper work from you and the new debt would need to be considered in the overall mortgage loan approval.   The lender cannot prevent you from opening a new account, but the process to verify the new debt can take extra time and may delay your closing date.\n\nAfter you close your mortgage loan, you are correct that there are some implications regarding how new debt impacts your credit rating.   First, each time you authorize a company to access your credit report, which is likely a requirement to apply for a new credit card, that company will register an inquiry on your master credit file and each inquiry can decrease your score a few points.   This should not be a major concern unless you apply with several credit card companies at the same time.   The decrease to your score should be temporary assuming you continue to make all your payments on time.   All new debts appearing on your credit report will have some impact as new debt is treated differently in the scoring models than more seasoned accounts.   However, the impact is based on many complicated factors including the total number of accounts that you have, the average time the accounts have been opened, and the total amount of outstanding balances on installment (mortgages, auto loans, etc) and revolving debts (credit cards).  Based on your current excellent credit rating, you should not expect a major negative impact to your score and any impact would rebound as you began to make payments on the new debt.  \n\nGenerally, your bank should not be able to prevent you from moving your money from one institution to another during the mortgage process.  It is possible that you have been approved under a special mortgage product with your bank based on your depository relationships, but generally compliance regulations would prevent your bank from changing the interest rate that you locked after it was disclosed to you.   You should be cautious of moving the money during the mortgage underwriting process only due to the fact that the lender may require additional documentation before closing to show your availability of funds and it can be more complicated to supply the requested documents on a newly created account."

If it's not very good the bank may not list it but any bank that is offering good APY will advertise it clearly.   \n\nThe big banks like Bank of America, Chase, etc. have very low APY, something like 0.04%.   The online banks, like Ally, have much higher APY, in the realm of 2.2%.   This is why banks like Ally advertise that they have High Yield Savings.   Don't take a bank's word for it though, always research the APY.\n\nNow let me give you some basic math examples so you can see what I'm talking about\n\nUncle Lester leaves ItsFressh with $5,000 in old Confederate bills.  After trading these bills in at an antiquities dealer, ItsFresh ends up with $50 and a pack of bubble gum.\n\nItsFressh takes the $50 and puts it in BofA at 0.04%.   To see the earned interest we multiple the balance ($50) by the interest rate (.04%).  If you remember calculating from math class percentages are already a decimal because 100% = 1 so 1% = .01.   \n\nAt 0.04% APY we have 50 * .0004 = .02.   So with BofA after an entire year of having your $50 on deposit you gain two cents.\n\nNow let's look at 2.2% APY with Ally\n\n50 * .0220 = $1.1\n\nSo after a year of leaving your $50 on deposit with ally, you earn an additional $1.10 in interest.   \n\nThe big banks will try to hide the fact that their APY is so meager that you will not see any substantial returns.   So be cautious of marketing slogans and just watch for actual values that you can do math on.   \n\nThat's how you'll graduate from using Acorns as well :)"

(Yikes, that\u2019s a lot\u2014but don\u2019t stop now!) Put them in order by balance from smallest to largest. Don't worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar balances\u2014then you\u2019ll list the debt with a higher interest rate first. This is called [the debt snowball method,](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-the-debt-snowball-method-works) and you\u2019ll use it to knock out your debts one by one.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to attack the first balance on your list. Pay as much as you can each month while making the minimum payments on your other debts. We mean go after it! Sell everything you can. Get a second job. Sell so much the kids think they\u2019re next! You want to get rid of that payment quickly. When you\u2019ve paid it off, add those payments to the monthly payment on your *next* debt and start attacking it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard work, but this is what winning looks like! The small wins you make at the beginning will keep you motivated to dump all your debt. And before you know it, you\u2019re debt-free! Millions of people have used our proven program, *Financial Peace University,* to learn how to never worry about money again.\n\nThe remaining baby steps: [https://www.daveramsey.com/baby-steps](https://www.daveramsey.com/baby-steps)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: You're broke so start acting like it and quit spending money you don't have.

If you sell for what you purchased for, there's no profit to tax.\n\nAre you keeping closing costs in mind? Depends on your area and loan program, but in my area, even if no real estate agents are involved, it still costs a Seller about 1% of the sale price in closing costs (just to pay for the paperwork to be processed and recorded), and a Buyer about 3% of the sale price in closing costs (paperwork processing and recording, plus all the costs to get the loan). So when you purchase from your mom, those would apply. When you sell back to her, if she's able to pay cash, it would be more like 1% to each of you since there's no loan. So just in closing costs, that's a $7,000 bill to your mom and $14,000 to you.\n\nYou also won't be able to turn around and sell it truly instantly, there's processing time. You'll be on the hook for mortgage interest for that time, though if it's for less than a month, it's not as significant of a hit than the closing costs.\n\nAs others are saying, it should be a lot simpler for your father to just sign over his stake in the home to your mother.

For the duration, invest the difference between the 15-year and 30-year monthly payments.\n\nSo, same monthly outflow for the full 30 years in both scenarios.\n\nBy my math, the \"break-even\" point was investment earnings of about 5.4% after taxes (assuming 15% capital gains tax, about 6.4% before tax). So mathematically, if I could get an investment return of at least 6.4%, Scenario 2 was better.

Escrow accounts need to keep a buffer in them. If I manage this myself, I can put in there exactly what I need. If the mortgage servicer doesn't take enough they can start charging suddenly to make up the deficit, and if they take too much, it takes months to get refunded. I like having the control.\n2. By keeping the funds in a high yield savings account, I gain interest. For mine it's about $50 a year which isn't a crazy amount, but why not take it?\n3. I can pay my home insurance with a credit card, and get 2% cash back on it. Another $40 a year that I wouldn't have otherwise. Technically I could also pay my property taxes with a credit card, but my county has a 2.45% fee to do so so not worth it. YMMV.\n\nSo yes, there are financial benefits. They're small, but worth it to me.

You do not get to deduct it on your taxes. Upon withdrawal, the entire thing is taxed at your regular income tax rate, both the original $3,500 and its earnings over the years. Plus, while you are in the process of paying back the 401k loan, you miss out on the investment growth during that time.\n\nOr you put it in a regular investment account.

In your example of the Sellers being generous and selling for less than market value, it doesn't matter, because if they sell to you for $80k instead of $100k, the bank then sees the value as $80k.\n\nWhen PMI is dropped as you make payments is a little weird, it's based on your amortization schedule. As soon as you are scheduled to have paid your loan down to, oddly, 78% of the original purchase price, not 80%, the PMI goes away. Federal law built in a little bit of buffer.\n\nHowever, if you make extra payments, or if you believe the home has risen enough in value that you now owe less than 80% of what it is actually worth, you can ask the bank to do a new appraisal of the home (which usually costs $400-$500). If you do in fact owe less than 80% of the actual appraised value (over 20% equity position) you can get the PMI removed manually. How soon you are able to do this after purchase may depend on the bank.\n\nFor FHA loans, the rules are entirely different. As long as your down payment is at least 10% of the purchase price, you can get the mortgage insurance removed... after 11 years. You still have mortgage insurance if you put down 20%. And if you put down less than 10%, you're stuck with it until the loan is paid off."

So any overtime pay will be for saving and some for personal leisure.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nTldr. Is it possible to bump credit to 640 from 530 in 1.5 years?"

I couldn't find a job that pay as well starting and lost all my savings, my new car and all the luxury we could afford. Credit went down hill.\n\nNow, I'm back on my feet, been on my job for about a year blessed. Got 2 raises so far and have like 3 more. I quit buying coffee and giving all my money to the wife since she doesn't spend on anything unless we go to the store. For needs. Some casual spending here and there but nothing crazy.\n\nI've become obsessed with saving this way, I plan on fixing my credit this year and hopefully by 2021 I can buy a house that we want and need. I'm just pushing this out there for people struggling that are making good money.\n\nCut out the bs spending and buy a coffee maker, learn how to cook good food, and try to read or play games when the urge to spend rises. \n\nI have my goals setup, I have read many books about life, money, and family. Habits. Habits are a big thing in success. Check out Atomic habits. It's a great book.\n\nAnyways. I'll update this post once I reach more goals. This time I'm saving to be happy. Not buying to make the temporary feeling feel happy."

I can afford this and these are wonderful homes that have all the bells and whistles, more than I need really. I've also noticed a few  houses that are very low priced about 34k that needs a little work done 10k and it would be in great shape,  that I could buy and be happy with since I don't feel I need much. There are downsides of course like being outdated, not having much of a yard and the location etc. My issue is my girlfriend of several years will be living with me and she keeps emailing me houses that are 80-100k and I really don't think I want to live in a nice house like this, yet anyway.

Attaching a PDF of my numbers sheet. Made a recent large  life change and move across country, so have some interesting  situations.\n\nExplanations of where some things stand:\n\n\\-  Employed full time at 14.00 an hour in Alaska. It's not what I'd look  at as a permanent gig, but unless a job opens up in my field  (Occupational Safety/HSE) then I'll probably ride this out until I move.\n\n\\- Living with my sister as of right now. I pay $250/month towards utilities and groceries, no rent payment.\n\n\\-  Savings was exhausted during my move. I'm rebuilding it and want to hit  at least 3.5k prior to this winter. Intending to move up to city with  boyfriend - better empl0yement opportunities (as opposed to the small  town where I'm at now) and would close the gap there, which is a bonus.  If/when I move, we'd be living together - I would be paying part of the  expenses\n\n\\- Car was financed through BoA,  at $300 a month, but when I moved my grandfather paid it off and I now  finance through him at income driven payments and a low/non-existent  interest rate (I didn't ask him for this, but God am I grateful). I  currently owe him about 23k. As per my numbers sheet, I've spoken with  him and we're planning on income driven payments. He wants me to rebuild  my savings and pay off high interest credit cards, so I'm going to auto  deduct 150 from my account to his each month on the 15th.\n\n\\-  I have two credit cards. One through discover with a $500 limit, with a  $300 balance and a 24% interest rate (this will get paid off this  month). The other is Capital One and is a 21% interest rate with a $3000  limit and $2000 - I had to use it to pay for my car to be shipped :(  I'll pay this off with big payments over the next 3-4 months. I have my  phone bill auto pay set to Capital One, which I plan on paying off as  soon as the payment processes each month once the card is 0 balance, and  my insurance is auto payed from my discover account - same plan.\n\n\\-  Car insurance is 150/mo for full coverage. I still have a 6 year  warranty and gap coverage that I purchased through Ford as well. (23 y.o  male so this number still fucking amazes me lol)\n\n\\-  My only expenses after everything is paid is gas to/from work and  boyfriend's place and money to eat out if/when I eat out (usually only  with bf, and he generally pays, so not a common expense)\n\n\\-Currently  sitting at $500 in savings. The last page of the PDF shows how much of  leftover expenses each month I plan on adding to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried making a PDF, but it wouldn't let me upload a link - so I did a very poorly executed thing and made imgur links... please excuse the confusion on that, and thank you to those who take the time to help out.\n\n[https://imgur.com/tdNwZKG](https://imgur.com/tdNwZKG)\n\n[https://imgur.com/YebK8dv](https://imgur.com/YebK8dv)\n\n[https://imgur.com/Me8oULd](https://imgur.com/Me8oULd)\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZHh9Z6u](https://imgur.com/ZHh9Z6u)\n\n[https://imgur.com/uhcOT2t](https://imgur.com/uhcOT2t)\n\n[https://imgur.com/uSdT2tw](https://imgur.com/uSdT2tw)\n\n[https://imgur.com/KzhMpPl](https://imgur.com/KzhMpPl)\n\n[https://imgur.com/Jd52PeQ](https://imgur.com/Jd52PeQ)\n\n[https://imgur.com/EmCNISs](https://imgur.com/EmCNISs)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Forgot about my student loans. I owe 17k, at 200/month payments beginning July. Variable interest rates ranging from 3.5 at the lowest to 4.8 at the highest.

I now have a credit score of 730 and would like to get a new car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKelly blue book says the car is worth maybe $3k-4k. I make about $33-36k a year and right now have $6k saved up.

I wouldn't mind moving over say maybe $1-2k from the previous loan. I now have my own financing and was told by my bank that my interest would be around 3-5% for a newer car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy question is what the best route to get what I want ?.

That would be the bare bones minimum and you'd incur MORE than that a month in interest. All this because you have the hope that you'll get federal forgiveness. This is a VERY bad plan that will guarantee you a life of poverty. 99% of people that applied for loan forgiveness were rejected. Also you're betting on being at this non-profit for 10 years which is just wishful thinking and very restricting. So 10 years down the line, when your application is rejected you'll owe 100,000 and THEN some.\n\nAs for the credit card, why did they not open their own card? Bad credit? Well now they've given you the gift of bad credit as well. Sofi won't lend to someone with a debt burden like you. Balance transfer cards up to 14k are also out of your reach.\n\nHere's what you should do. Come to the realization you're in a bad financial state. You should be scared. It needs to hit you like a bolt of lightning. Action is required.\n\nStep 1: Sell the car and buy a beater for cash. Put the remainder of the sale towards this credit card debt. Former car payment + 1k from you + 1K of parent goes towards CC. This will have you out of CC debt in about 6-8 months if you're disciplined.\n\nStep 2: Find a job that pays more. You spent 100k on school, a return on investment should get you a job making at least 10-20k more than that in the private sector. You NEED a higher income to afford the payments you're required to make in the future. The debt burden you've taken on has limited your options, no more limited employment until debt is gone.\n\nStep 3: When you're done with the CC pay off student debt aggressively. Don't wait for money interest to accumulate in deferment. 1500 a month minimum (on your current salary, more when you get a higher paying job) and whatever you can spare and maybe you'll be out of debt in 7-8 years and then be able to begin not being poor. I know this sounds harsh but you should start thinking this way if you don't want to be stressed out of your mind barely making ends meet for the rest of your life. You'll work until your 70 and have literally nothing to show for it at this pace.\n\nHope this helps."

If you pay and dissolve 2-3 active credit accounts at once, and you only have 1-2 active accounts, you may take a hit. From my understanding a credit score is not only for creditors to see if you\u2019ll pay it back, but to see if they can make money off of you. Are you actively contributing the credit industry as a whole? Also something that just came to mind. If you pay down a debt early, the lender, while likely charging you for early pay down, is still not generating as much interest as the debt was scheduled to make. It says to other creditors that you\u2019ll pay down a debt any chance you get and the interest they had planned to charge you over say 10 years is not reliable. "

Just google Excel Budget Template. \n\nI would start there. \n\nFigure out how much you need for essential living expenses every month. Metro Pass ($120ish a month last I checked) food, rent, school supplies, utilities, phone bill, etc. Be realistic. Include all fixed expenses and add a little cushion. From there you will know roughly how much you need monthly to simply survive. \n\nExtrapolate from that number. How much do you need, bare minimum, to live for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months? \n\nOpen at least one checking account. I prefer two. And a savings account. \n\nI draft all essential essential living expenses from one checking account. Everything I can autodraft or prepay comes from that account. I do not purchase non-essential things from that account. Most of my paycheck goes in here. \n\n\nThe second account is essentially pocket money. Give yourself a limit. Night out. Concert. New TV. Late night amazon purchases. It puts a reliable cap on how much I can foolishly spend on lifestyle nonsense. \n\nI use my savings as overdraft protection and... saving. I take a portion of my pay and have it directly deposited into my savings. It gains better interest and remains largely untouched outside of emergencies and preplanned larger expenses ie unexpected medical expenses, down payment on a vehicle or home and so on. \n\nHope this helps.

This year, I got a $3,000 refund but I noticed on the TurboTax printout (the records PDF with cover sheet, e-filing instructions/etc) that there is a section called \"Estimated Payments to Make for Next Year's Return,\" which says that if I expect to owe more than $1,000 in 2019, I may incur an underpayment penalty if I don't make certain estimated tax payments (4 payments of $293).  I am a little surprised by this.  Does this mean that TurboTax estimates that I will underpay in 2019?  That seems strange given that I've never owed, and my wife and I (married filing jointly) both put 0 allowances and married but withhold at higher single rate under our W4s.  Why would the software all of a sudden think I may start owing?  If anything, this year I plan to bump up my 401k contributions (from 6% to 12%) and my wife has started contributing towards a 401k for the first time (maxing out), which should significantly drop our taxable income, no?

Since then, we've still had refunds each year but it significantly went down this year due to the cap on SALT.  However, another big change this year is that my wife is now maxing out the 401k contribution (\\~$19k) and I'll be doubling my 401k contribution (from \\~7k to 14k).

He said that he would wait for several payroll contributions (to let my account build up with $) before purchasing investments (and would wait again in between each new purchase) because it will cost a fixed amount of money (approx $70, if i remember correctly) each time I purchase shares, regardless of how many I'm buying, so that it makes sense to wait in between purchases?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very new to investment/retirement accounts but this sounds odd to me.  Are you typically charged by your 401k plan for each time you buy more shares of an investment fund?  With my previous employer, I simply picked a target date fund and each payroll deduction, Charles Schwab (old plan) would buy X amount of shares of that target date fund with my entire biweekly payroll contribution, and I don't remember being charged for each purchase.  I want to call Wells Fargo back to find out more details about the fees, etc., to make sure I'm not being overcharged.  What should I be asking?

I can contribute up to 10% of my gross pay on each paycheck. My company will match 40% of whatever I contribute PLUS an extra 20 euro stipend per month. It is a EU company so everything will eventually get converted back to USD eventually, FWIW. The company contribution is subject to income tax and social contributions and will be taken out by payroll. The dividends, net of EU tax, are reinvested in (fractional) shares. They may be taxable, too. Lastly, there are blackout periods for legal reasons, but I can cash out my stock whenever I'd like to.\n\nWhat I was considering was putting in my monthly contribution, getting the 40% match + 20 euros, and then when it becomes available (by the 9th of every month), immediately sell my shares. That way the stock price has changed very minimally hopefully, and I could take the match &amp; stipend and just pay taxes on those.. and obviously on the gains/losses. Essentially, I could contribute 766.67 per month and get roughly 329.17 in match &amp; contribution from my company, each month. I am already contributing to my 401k and getting the maximum of the employer match so I'm thinking this may be a better option to try to make some more money, and then each month when I cash out my shares, dump the money into my Roth IRA until it is maxed out.

You could use ETFs to get the split earlier, but I prefer simple.\n\n\n\nOnly time you want to increase bonds is in the few years before retirement, and then you draw then down over the first decade  of retirement.  It's called a bond tent and is used to reduce the risk in the first decade (which is when the risk of failure due to market collapse is the highest)."

I took over the finances 1-2 years into the relationship (we've now been married over 10) when I realized how terrible she is with money.\n\nI budget EVERYTHING, all of it, our budget has over 20 line items (we also have a kid, so things like music tutor is it's own line item).\n\nEach of us has a monthly, rolling, personal fund.  Hers is 3x as big as mine.  We also both have a lunch budget (again, her's bigger than mine) that we can use flexibly (work snacks, taking a friend out to lunch, etc).  Most of the time we don't use up our whole lunch budgets as we bring in food, but it's there (and does not roll over month to month).\n\nSo, what is a personal expense?  Oh, we've had a few fights over it, but simply put anything that is for one person and isn't a need.  New clothes for work, that's shared shopping budget.  New clothes because this shirt was so pretty and on sale, that's a personal purchase.  Beer (my wife doesn't drink) well... that's most of my personal budget (and my books/video games, that's pretty much my whole entertainment package right there).\n\nAnything work related is shared budget, for me (IT) that means certification stuff and my wife works in fitness so she also has monthly/yearly certifications to maintain.  My wife is starting to work on finishing her BA (finally), so that is also shared budget.\n\nGifts come from a shared budget that rolls over (we're currently over on that one, stupid family getting married).\n\nIf one of us stops working (most likely my wife) then their personal budget will drop (but they will still have some personal spending).\n\nIt's not perfect, my wife is almost always over budget but compared to what we did before it's a major improvement.  We went from nearly pay check to paycheck to having a savings rate of 43.6% in a year (and I took a signifigant pay cut in that time, which was how I was able to get a tighter budget put in place)."

I usually work anywhere between 10-20 hrs overtime per week at 1.5 times my normal hourly wage all hours after 40 hours. I haven't been employed since before I filed my 2018 taxes. I'll start this new job in May.\n\nFrom my understanding, for the 2019 tax year, I will be taxed 12% federally if I earn $39,475 or less this year. With overtime, over a 1 year period, I will most definitely exceed that, but given that I started in the middle of the year, I won't get past $39,475 by tax season so I will remain in the 12% bracket for the 2019 tax year rather than being bumped up to the 22% tax bracket. Is my line of reasoning correct?\n\nGiven that I live with my mother and she's the head of household and I'm filing as single, would it behoove me to move out in 2020 to my own place and become head of household to extend the 12% tax bracket to a maximum of $52,850 (assuming I cap my overtime to make sure I don't exceed that)? If so, does it matter when I become head of household in 2020 for tax purposes? Suppose for the 2020 tax year, I still lived with my mother up until the month before tax season in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, would I be able to file as head of household still or would have to file as single since I spent most of the year living with my mother?\n\n[Here's the source I used for tax brackets for 2019 tax year.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/)\n\nClarification questions are welcome if it means you getting to give me a more accurate answer."

She's been terrible with money, and at this point has, to her name, a lease on a subsidized apartment, enough furniture to fill it, her social security, enough savings to bridge the gap between ss and basic expenses for a half year or so, and a cat. \n\nWe're all she has family-wise, so while she hasn't yet explicitly asked for help, we know it's coming.

I'm late to the party (28) and decided on a Roth IRA account with Vanguard since my employer doesn't offer 401k matching. If I understand correctly, Target retirement is okay but not the first recommendation because of fees and not being as growth orientated as a custom portfolio; ETF's are good if you don't have a lot to invest initially; Mutual funds are best if you are able to get admiral status despite the small fees associated with it and there is some \"managing\" going on in mutual funds. So based on that I have the funds for mutual funds so I will be going with VTSAX. I have read something about 3 fund portfolios and diversifying, but can't seem to find what people would recommend besides VTSAX, so what else is there? If I put the full 5,500 into VTSAX will I be easily able to reallocate some funds from there to a different mutual fund or ETF if I want to diversify my portfolio in the future? Lastly, is there anything tax related I need to fill out since I'm just in the process of opening this account? My total Gross income in 2018 was 5833 since I started my job mid year, and I didn't get another paycheck until Jan 2019, I'm just worried that I may have put too much in my Roth IRA for the 2018 year.

Heck, you might even want to try getting both because the student card seems to only do 5% in one category for while and then it changes to a different category.

At least keep 3 months worth of expenses set aside for a time of need to give you time to get back on your feet if something were to ever come up. Once the 40k is paid off you can look to saving for retirement with 401k if your employer offers matching. If they don't offer matching you can then research a Roth IRA account instead. With all this said, work to increase your income so you'll have an easier time saving up for the 90k when the time comes that you are ready to have your child.

If you have the discipline to stick to a plan and come out ahead with more money, then by all means execute it. I use to have the same mindset about credit cards and I stayed away from them for the longest time because of DR. After doing some reading on different opinions and such, I recently started a credit line because I also didn't think I was someone that needed to go to such extremes. His method is effective because it keeps people focused and less likely to derail. \n\nI wasn't sure how your bonus worked so I just did 70k/12 which is just below 6k, so that's how I got that. \n\nIf you really want to keep the car then yeah, it's doable. I would just make sure I paid off the CC before interest starts on that, so that would be 400 a month to that to pay off by Feb. Throw everything extra at the car and just do minimum payments on the student loan. Lastly throw everything at the student loan when car and cc are paid off, best to focus on one at a time.\n\nI think postponing retirement for a year isn't so bad. That's just the cost to have peace of mind sooner rather than later. It's more about increasing morale so that when you throw extra money at the debts you can see progress being made and are more likely to continue with your plan. Keeping the car and continuing to add to your retirement are both doable and if you want to you could do it. The only drawback is that you'll be in a lock longer than if you were to switch things up."

Don't let the Money Market part throw you off, it's just like a savings account. Only, you get a card linked to the account and can use it to access the funds. Like a savings account you are limited to 6 transactions without fees. If you are unsure, just go with Ally because a lot of people recommend it so it's a safe bet. Do this first and then continue your research later on. Next, you want to ask your employer if they offer 401k matching, if they do, do more research about it and deposit the maximum they will match. Just 2 weeks ago I didn't know what investing looked like either, so don't worry, if I can figure it out, so can you! After your 401k you will want to research what you can about ROTH IRA, this is where you invest savings for retirement. There are different companies to do this with and I went with Vanguard. It's more simple to do and setup than it is to understand how it works. Check out Stephan Graham Stephan on youtube, he made it much more understandable for me in many different financial areas. Now that all of this is done, you can look more extensively into a better savings account. After all this is done, it's just about budgeting, saving for retirement, and increasing your income."

It's better for you to try to increase your income in the next 5 years rather than worry and try to rely on a couple thousand dollars.

First of all sell the car, hands down, no question about it; then buy a used car that's at least 4 years old to get by with. With that done you could probably use your savings to buy a used car, and have +650 a month not worrying about a car payment. DR suggests a temporary EF of 1000 to start with. He also suggests you temporarily put a stop to retirement investments while trying to get out of debt, so you will have another 500 to work with if you were to stop with the 401k and HSA. Take a look at your subscriptions and see if you are actually using all of them, if you aren't, cancel some (no biggie if you are using all of them and don't want to cancel them though). I would make a payment plan so that your CC is paid off before any interest is accrued onto it, any thing extra/leftover from all the suggestions I gave you, throw it at the student debt. 90k a year is good, with all the suggestions I gave you, you should be able to to pay off your student loan debt in at least 12 months. 90k a year should at least be 6k a month minus 2k for expenses, you should be able to throw 4k a month to your debt. If you're paranoid about an EF, 6k should be enough to fulfill your needs for 3 months. Renting temporarily while getting out of debt is no problem. So instead of saving for a house you could be putting that money towards debt as well. In a year when you have no expenses, you could easily be saving 3k a month towards a new house while still having money leftover to have fun."

The salary is 50,000 with a 10% yearly bonus. 31 PTO days (which you are encouraged to take), free catered breakfast and lunch, work from home option when I would like, and flexspend account for transportation costs. \n\nI\u2019m still in the process of getting my license so the reimbursement for the transportation costs is a great plus for me. And I plan on applying for medical school next year so the flexible PTO is a huge plus for me. \n\nMy question is: given that the compensation is above average for my location (ave=48,000) plus the benefits are already competitive, is it worth negotiating for a high salary? I\u2019ve heard that \u201cyou should never take the first offer given\u201d but I\u2019m not quite sure if I should heed that advice. \n\nThanks for any input you have!!  \n\nEDIT: I decided to negotiate rather than take the initial offer and they responded to my counter offer of $55,000 with a sign on bonus of $5,000! Thanks to everyone for your input! I\u2019m glad I took that intiative and it was definitely a great learning lesson to advocate for myself"

Is there any particular reason why WF hasn't increased my limit?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have any debt besides a car lease which ends in less then 2 years from now. Never missed a payment.

The saleman there can show them to you but they don\u2019t really want to show you figures that scare you away. They just show you your monthly payment that\u2019s it. (Or at least they try too)\n\nThere\u2019s a website dedicated to giving you the lease vehicle prices but I forgot what it was. It\u2019s been a while. But basically they usually get their depreciation number spot on but you have wiggle room in the \u201crenting\u201d department. Don\u2019t be afraid to back out. Ask them to lower it to a figure you think is good. If they don\u2019t come down, just say thank you and leave. Most of the time they call you back because they don\u2019t believe your bluff. However, there\u2019s a small chance they are going to not call you back but I\u2019m sure they will take their original deal.\n\nAlso, try to get those miles to a minimum of 12,000. Their depreciation cost is based on their standard annual mileage (which I believe it\u2019s 12K for VW). I would also advise against accepting any of their \u201cservice packages\u201d. We took one for the 2016 Fusion not realizing it\u2019s only a 3 time thing which we paid over $400 (for 3 years) and only got 3 oil changes out of it 1 of which was done without our permission. We took the car in for a warranty issue like 2 months after the previous oil change and they did an oil change...\n\nJust pretend you\u2019re interest in the packages to the salesman. Once you go talk to the actual person that does the contract. Make sure you say no to all their packages (I think GAP is required if not it should come by default and I\u2019m unaware if you can even take it off) but all their other packages, say no to them.\n\nI would also be cautious of the tires near the end of the lease. If they need replacing then they will specifically pick 4 expensive tires and charge you for them. If they do truly need to be replaced, I recommend buying 4 cheap used tires. They work and they can\u2019t complain.\n\nYou may or may not need brakes. I would also try to push that back as much as you can and not replacement if you really don\u2019t need too. It is a lease after all, you\u2019re not keeping it and their \u201crent fee\u201d calculates this into it in case a customer doesn\u2019t replace all their maintenance. This means if they charge a high rent plus they get to charge their customers more, it\u2019s a win win for them. If they don\u2019t then it\u2019s just a small win. They always come out on top. That\u2019s why they make billions.\n\nI may have gone really far away from the main topic. Sorry about that. Final words. I recommend a 36 months lease (39 doesn\u2019t hurt). Get 10K+ yearly miles at minimum. Keep telling them you want a lower offer until they seem annoyed (they will take their time to annoy you in hopes you take a deal and leave). Make sure floor mats, spare tire, owners manual and other stuff is included, they sometime take it out and forget to put it back in and then they charge you for it. Don\u2019t buy any \u201cmaintenance\u201d packages. Try to not put any money down on a lease."

You both need to pull your weight in this, one of you cant do it alone.\n\nStep two is a budget, sit down and write down everything coming in and everything going out for you and your fiancee. look at your list and cut everything that you don't need to live/work. From your post alone there are a lot of subscriptions that you can't afford to be paying. Get cheaper phone plans, I'm talking track phone/prepaid, you guys don't have the income to be paying $110 a month for cell phones. Shop around for cheaper car insurance.

Pay everything in cash, not even a debit card if you can help it.\n\nStep three is to get out from under those car payments. Normally I would say pay of the credit cards (keep making minimum payments tho) but your car payments are killing you. Put as much of your now freed up money as you can into not being under water on one of the cars, once you break even sell the car and pay off the loan. Replace it with something much much cheaper that is very gas efficient, this is your new commuter car. Now put everything you were putting towards the old car towards the second high car payment and do the same thing. After this put all your extra money towards the credit cards and pay them off. Once these are paid pay off any remaining balance one the new cheaper cars.\n\nStep four is to keep your credit card balance zero and start saving money for an emergency, start with a $1k goal and work towards 6 months expenses. Once you have that treat it like a zero balance, that money is for an emergency.\n\nThrough this whole process I would recommend looking into ways to increase your income, working side jobs on weekends, pulling extra shifts at work, w/e you can to help you pay down that debt faster. It is going to be a hard road but it's doable of you stick to it.

Consider seeking out ways to get more comfortable with death and the temporary nature of life... that might be the ultimate source of your stress."

There is a 1-2 week window between paying off the lien and getting the title from the bank. This form will serve as like a temporary title for the buyer.\n\n\n3. The lien holder sends the clean title to either you or the seller, and at that point the transaction is basically complete.\n\n\nThere's not much you have to work out with your bank. All they really care about is getting the money from somewhere. It's up to the seller to arrange with his bank and/or pay in cash. Many people also use what's called an escrow account for the transaction (which is basically just an account where the buyer puts money, and then you get the money after they send the title, just to make sure there isn't fraud in the transaction).\n\n\nFor more information on how much money this will net you, go to kbb.com and look at the difference in value between trade-in and private sale."

Know that the difference in making the \u201cwrong\u201d choice between Roth and traditional will only be effectively a few small percent difference in your wealth when you retire.

Some ETFs get even more specific, following industries like natural gas, tech, or utilities.\n\nFor more specific guidance, look at some target retirement date funds (many brokerages have them) for dates close to when you'd like to retire. You can either mirror these investments, or actually invest into these funds. Many of them have low expense ratios and are managed to have appropriate levels of risk depending on your timeline. Here's an [article from Vanguard](https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/ekit/pmed/trf/index.html?ajdejc&amp;abqu&amp;&amp;) that goes more into the specifics.\n\nAs for taxes, that all depends. Some ETFs pay dividends, which are taxed. These dividends will either come in the form of checks, or will be credited to your brokerage account (some brokerages even allow you to reinvest dividends automatically). However, for the actual ETF shares, you don't pay any taxes until you sell the shares (like a stock). If you sell the shares after owning them for less than a year, your gains are taxed at a high rate (short term capital gains), however, if you hold on to them for a while, your gains are taxed at a much lower rate (long term capital gains). \n\nTo be clear, you pay taxes on the GAINS, not the overall value of the stock. For example: If you buy a share of an ETF at $10, then sell it off later for $40, the gain of $30 is taxed, not the overall value of the share at $40. Of course, most brokerages will automatically prepare you a 1099 around tax time with all of your sales and dividends accounted for, so you shouldn't have to worry about the nitty-gritty."

That being said, it is absolutely, 100% necessary that you pay it off before the promo ends. For most promo deals, if you reach the end of the deal and haven't paid off your balance, a high interest rate is retroactively applied to your previous balance and suddenly you're left with a nasty surprise of a high balance and a ludicrous interest rate.\n\nI would put aside the money that you'd need to pay off the CC debt and either put into a high-yield savings account or a CD that expires about a month before your promo rate ends. At that point, you can pay off the CC and pocket the interest that you earned."

He's made a deal with the DA to do a few years. (How long exactly will be determined in a few weeks at sentencing.)\n\nHe's young, only 22, but will be about 28-31 when he gets out.\n\nHe's never used his credit for anything. I've been doing some research, and found that lots of inmates find that they have nil credit when they're released, things having \"fallen\" off of their reports.\n\nSo after talking it over with his father and him, we'd like to be a little more proactive, so that once he's out he'll have the credit he'll need to get an apartment or get a car or what-have-you.\n\nThe plan is for him to grant his dad Power of Attorney over his finances. Then open one or two secured credit cards. Over the course of his time down, his dad will make a few small purchases with the cards to send him things he'll need and then pay them back in full.\n\nThe question is, where can we go from there? He won't have much earning power in there, so his total available credit will be low, but his other factors should be OK. He'll have a couple of older accounts open and in good standing, likely no derogatory marks, and an excellent payment history.\n\nThis all seems like a good idea in theory, rather like how some parents open credit accounts in their kids' names so that they've got good credit when they turn 18.\n\nBut sometimes good ideas can be disastrous.

How much is hard to say, but you have a great score, so I\u2019d think not a lot.\n\nThat being said, the mortgage you're about to be responsible for will also impact your score, more so than the card will. The mortgage is installment debt, which affects your score differently, but until you prove your ability to pay your new debt on time (probably about 6 months), your score will go down.  No big deal if you\u2019re not planning any other purchases, such as a car.\n\nAnyway, congrats on the condo! (edit - spelling)"

Our debt was quickly out of control with credit cards, student loans, and our own foolish car purchase (it was one of those make no payments for a year deals) that we ended upside down on when the car was totaled and we owed more than it was worth (and now had no car).  My point is, you're not alone, you have the power to change course, and you're learning valuable financial lessons for the future.  It going to take hard work, frugal living, and patience, but you can do this.\n\nYou're definitely in a tight spot, but good for you for realizing that something has to change, and not just spiraling further into debt.  I'm a bit of a plain talker, so my apologies if any of this sounds harsh; it's just my two cents:\n\n1. You already realize that buying the car was a mistake (as an aside, that's a pretty shady dealership for getting you into a seven year loan).  Having only paid one year of a seven year loan, my guess is that you'd be in the hole by about $5k if you somehow disposed of the car.  \n\n* You can check the value yourself at a website like [kbb.com](https://kbb.com); it might be worth a bit more. \n* I don't think getting rid of the car is a realistic option unless you can find someone to buy it for what you owe, which is unlikely.  \n* You could find yourself in an additional pickle a few years from now with maintenance costs on the car.  You do have the option of not driving it, not insuring it, and not registering it.  Tread carefully if you do this, every locality is a bit different, but generally you'd need somewhere out of sight to park it, like a garage. An untagged, unregistered car on the street will be towed.  To be clear, this is not a great option, and you should check locally to see what the rules are if you decide to do this.  Not driving a car also has a potential mechanical impact.\n\n2.   You live in a VERY expensive area of the country for housing.  If you're capable of staying put, you should   \nconsider it.\n\n3.   Without income, you'll continue to rack up debt, most likely using your credit card(s) for daily living   \nexpenses.  My personal opinion is that you're going to need a job, and find some way to balance work and   \nschool.  Don't get into the habit of using your card to pay for daily expenses' it adds up quick.  Our credit   \ncard hole was the same; we were using it to pay our insurance premiums because we didn't have the cash,   \nand it quickly got out of control.  It's much harder to dig out than get in.\n\nI would focus hard on not incurring additional debt at this point.  What's done is done, and again, good on you for realizing it and trying to put a stop to it.  You're studying in an excellent field with great employment prospects.  My guess is that you're going to get good at living a frugal lifestyle for the next few years, which will only help you appreciate what you have in the future, and hopefully set you on the path to financial freedom.  Good luck.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;"

There is quality of life too.  I'd like to have a house but I probably should have a retirement.  (That's assuming I live that long, etc.)  It's not my parent's generation for house buying I guess.  I don't quite like the idea of always living in an apartment, dealing with idiot landlords.   A townhouse or condo sounded interesting when I thought about this before too...."

I see the same situation coming up possibly that I considered in the past although a few details have changed.\n\n\nI am still in repayment on my federal student loan for a few more years.  That's based on my AGI.  So if I lower my AGI on my federal taxes, my student loan payments are lower (by 15%, I'm on income based repayment) for 12 months.  That's sticking money in a traditional retirement account so I'm not paying taxes now.  Whatever amount I can stick in an IRA (up to the max on that) would be the basis for my student loan recalculation, which uses 15% of income above the poverty line, so it would be \"saving\" 15% of that max IRA contribution on my next 12-month student loan payment cycle.  For example, if $5,500 is the max IRA contribution for Year 2018 taxes, 15% is $825.  If I do nothing with the IRA, my adjusted gross income is up $5,500, and I pay $825 over the near-future 12-month student loan repayment cycle.  If I do max out the $5,500, my student loan gets recalculated $825 lower over that next 12-month repayment cycle.  There's no future retirement tax waiting on the student loan.  My student loan should be forgiven in a few years.  I'm on track for that.  In a sense, it's investing $5,500 in a traditional IRA (pay taxes later when I take it out) but it gets me back $825 in the near-future.  That's already a 15% return \"now\" (during the next 12-month student loan repayment cycle) on that $5,500.\n\n\nChange since 2016 -- My job changed a little.  I now have benefits, including retirement.  It some kind of traditional retirement.  I'm thinking that's not a Roth, so I'm probably not paying taxes now.  I'm paying x% of my income into that.  I'm looking at my Year 2018 W2 though.  I can't tell if my #1 \"Wages, tips, other comp,\" includes what I would have paid into the employeer's retirement thing.  The retirement option wasn't an option.  It was a \"choice\" between their retirement plan options.  A percent of my income went into that, no opt out choice.  I bring this up since it would affect how much I might pay into an IRA now (for Year 2018).\n\n\nI did set up a Vanguard account around 2016, but never used it.  As far as I know, it's still there, ready to go.  I was thinking when I decide on this, I could drop some money in that (minimum IRA is $3,000 I think, or was in 2016).  I'm not sure how I get the paperwork for Year 2018 taxes though so have the Year 2018 IRS forms filled out properly).\n\n\nSo my goal is to reduce my AGI on federal taxes for Year 2018 by throwing money into an IRA.  What's the max retirement contribution allowed for Year 2018 (was $5,500 in Year 2017 I think)?  I wonder if I'm missing a form from the work retirement plan.  I'm not sure how much I (was forced) contribute to that for Year 2018.\n\n\nIt looks like on IRS 1040 year 2018, Schedule 1, line 32, there's a spot for IRA contributions.  That uses form 8606.  I don't see a \"maximum of $5,500\" or anything like that anywhere though.....\n\n\nIt looks like I'd only be doing this year and maybe next year if I decide to do it.  I'm just fuzzy on how to contribute to Vanguard with an IRA, how to get paperwork for Year 2018 from them, how much I can max out that IRA deduction (if that's $5,500), if anything from work retirement now affects that....\nBack on my Year 2018 W2 form from work, I do have box 13 checked for retirement plan now.\n\n\nFound this.\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits\n\"For 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, your total contributions to all of your traditional and Roth IRAs cannot be more than:\n\n$5,500 ($6,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older), or\nyour taxable compensation for the year, if your compensation was less than this dollar limit.\"\n\n"

I would stay away from any negatives, but if it comes up, spin it in a positive light -- You learned something from that and are improving in that area.  You'd do something different next time because you learned from it.\n\nYou can also mention time in with the company.  And experience doing your job overall.  Even if it doesn't quite fit the job, you can remind them of experience that *might* benefit the job and count it as some experience or \"professional experience\" at least.\n\n\nAre you doing anything to improve job skills?  Any professional development?\n\n\nWhat about cost of living?  If they're not giving you a raise to keep up with inflation, you're actually getting paid less \"value\" each year. Surely they should value you as much now as they did at the start, or even more since you've got a little more experience... right?\n\n\nIf you can scope out similar jobs in the same geographic region, that's good too.  That's the market value.  On another hand, it doesn't matter how great you are -- This is the job they want, and this is how much your area is paying for that work.  If you've got more, great, but they only really need what the job needs.\n\n\nOr do they?  Do you want to take on some more work?  Do something a little different or more with your work?  (Or are you already doing more since somebody else left?)  And shouldn't you get paid for that extra work you're already doing or can do in the future?\n\n\nConsider that it's possible someone wants to give you a raise.  They just need some help, some reasons, to justify it.\n\n\nIf you're talking to someone, don't be afraid to leave pauses.  They might cave and add in more, tell you more, or just give you a raise then.  If they said, \"Why should we give you a raise at all?\" you can say, \"Well, there's cost of living to start... I mean, we're going to keep up with inflation at least... right?  That's only fair to be paid the some value each year, right?  You're not valuing my work any less this year, right?  ......\"  And then leave an awkward pause.   How do you say no to that?   (They say no one else got a raise either.  It's out of their hands.  \n\n\nSome things can be spun off as a low grade threat too.  Why a raise?  Because there are three similar job position openings in the area and they each pay x amount, but the job you're at now pays less.  (Implying you could just job hop for higher pay.)\n\n\nThose are just some ideas though.  Search for info under \"negotiation.\"  There's a lot out there.  If you go through enough, when something comes up during the meeting, you can remember enough gist of what to say then.\n\n\nThere are psychological tricks too, like supposedly if they have something warm in their hands, they're more open toward helping you.   Or if you do something for them or ask them for a favor, that helps their impression of you so they feel obligated to help you out too.  You could even use that during the meeting if it's worded carefully.... \"I've been meaning to ask you about that.  I was thinking of doing this for professional development.  Do you think that's a good idea?  Would it help my career here to improve in that area, or is there something else you think I should be focusing on for professional development?\"\n\n\nAlso, practice it.  Have some talking points or a schpiel made up already.  Practice it with another person.  Practice it by imagining the other person.  Record yourself and see how it sounds.  If possible, check out the room you'll be meeting with them in so you're more comfortable there."

CAGR is compound annual growth rate. That's the average annual return of each market. \n\nAs you can see, US and European markets go through periods where one outperforms the other. However, from 1986 to 2014, their final returns were identical. US has pulled away and has significantly outperformed Europe in the last 5 years or so. \n\nInvesting 100% into VTSAX is fine. It has a very small yearly expense ratio of 0.04% ($0.40 fee per $1,000 invested into the fund or $4 per $10,000) and with over 3,500 different companies in portfolio, it's very well diversified in regard to US market. \n\nA Vanguard 2060 Target Fund is a fine investment as well. The \"2060\" is your approximate retirement age. You can pick a further target date like Vanguard 2065 (VLXVX). The further away from retirement you are, the more stocks compared to bonds the fund holds. Difference between 2060 and 2065 are practically non existent. As you approach closer to retirement, your % of bonds will automatically increase and % of stocks will decrease. You can handle wild market swings now because you have a steady income and are 30+ years from retirement. But someone who is retired and depends financially solely on this money will not be able to handle a -30% yearly swing, for example. \n\nVanguard 2060 Target Fund holds approximately 54% US stocks, 18% European stocks, 18% Asian stocks, and 10% bonds. VTSAX is already a holding in this fund and makes up the entire US portion. \n\nAccording to https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vttsx/quote.html Vanguard Target Fund 2060 (VTTSX) has an expense ratio of 0.15%. That comes out to a yearly fee of $1.50 per $1,000 invested into the fund. That's still a great ER and shouldn't really be the sole determining factor when picking between the two. \n\nIf you invest in VTSAX, you'll probably have to manually start to allocate more % toward bonds when you turn 50 (earlier depending on your risk tolerance). With a Target Fund, that will be done automatically for you. That's your \"deposit money and forget it\" option. \n\nThird option is to just buy 60% VTSAX and 40% VTIAX (Vanguard Total International Stock; ER 0.11%). Or 50-50. Or 75-25. Your choice. This way you are invested only in global equities now and can manually buy bonds as you get closer to retirement. \n\nHere is a great site that allows you to play around with difference allocations to see what works for you https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/ \n\nBest of luck. \n\nEDIT: The fact that you have started at such a young age is far more important than any allocation you choose.

Add 1 extra year and it grows to $1.407 million. If you waited 8 years, turned 30, and just started to invest then, the same contributions and rate of return would yield only $726K. Almost 50% less.

            "text": "Great job starting so early. You are way ahead of the rest of us. I know I wasn't planning for retirement at that age!\n\nLooking at your selections, two things stand out. One, you bought exchange traded funds (ETF) rather than index funds. They perform the same but one of the major differences is that you can only buy whole shares of ETFs while you can buy partial shares of index funds. For example, if you have $100 monthly to invest and want to buy shares of an ETF which trades at $75 per share, you can only buy 1 share and will have $25 left over. If the rest of ETFs on your list are all over $25 per share, you have to wait until the following month when you add another $100 to buy more shares. With an index fund, you can buy partial shares. For example, you can buy 1.33 shares worth of $75 index fund with $100.\n\nIf you prefer ETFs over index funds (you can buy ETF during trading hours which you cannot do with index funds), then you have to consider consolidating your list from 5 to 2, for example.  \n\nFor one, you have a lot of overlap between MGK and VUG. (Great job picking low expense ratio funds by the way) \n\nMGK $125 per share (69% mega / 31% large) with 120 holdings, 0.83% yield, ER 0.07%. Top 5 holdings are:\n\nApple 7.63%\n\nAmazon 7.03% \n\nMicrosoft 4.47%\n\nFacebook 4%\n\nGoogle 3.48% \n\nVUG: $157 per share (55% mega / 34% large / 11% mid), 302 holdings, Yield 1.18%, ER 0.05%. Top 5 holdings are:\n\nApple 6.20%\n\nAmazon 5.71%\n\nMicrosoft 3.63%\n\nFacebook 3.85%\n\nGoogle 2.82%\n\nKeep VBK and consolidate the other four into either MGK or VUG. This way you now only have two ETFs to fund rather than 5. \n\nAlternatively, you can buy Vanguard Large Cap Growth index funds like VIGAX or VIGRX which had identical returns to VUG. This way your $100 monthly investment will allow you to buy partial shares. \n\nEDIT: Reddit doesn't allow shortened links.\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2019&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;endDate=03%2F31%2F2019&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;symbol1=VUG&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=VIGRX&amp;allocation2_2=100&amp;symbol3=VIGAX&amp;allocation3_3=100"

The difference in ER between ITOT and FXAIX is so tiny (0.03% vs 0.02%) that ER shouldn't really matter when picking between the two. \n\nAn ER of 0.03% equates to $0.30 yearly fee per $1,000 invested into the fund. At $15K, that's $4.50 per year. At 0.02%, it's $3 per year. An extremely insignificant difference. \n\nAn index fund tracks a specific sector or component of the market. For example, FTEC only tracks technology companies. It's the least diversified fund you are holding because it ignores all other sectors (auto, banking, pharmaceuticals, retail, etc. for example). With 214 holdings, it's also the least diversified in size. A fund that tracks only technology sector but has 1,000 holdings, for example, is more diversified. Diversification reduces risk. Let's say you have 10 pencils and your friend has 100 pencils. You both lose 1 pencil. You lost 10% of your total, he lost 1%. In a fund, you are diversifying to reduce risk of some companies severely underperforming or going bankrupt.  \n\nITOT is the most diversified fund in your Roth IRA. It tracks the entire stock market. Every sector is represented. With 3,565 holdings, it's also the most diversified relative to size. ITOT is actually an exchange traded fund (ETF) rather than an index fund. It trades like a regular stock and you can buy and sell an ETF during trading hours. You buy/sell an index fund after the market closes. At the end of the day, an index fund and an ETF will have the same closing price. There is virtually no difference between the two. \n\nITOT (77% large, 17% mid cap, 6% small cap) - 3,565 holdings\n\nFXAIX (90% large cap, 10% mid cap, 0% small cap) - 505 holdings\n\nFXAIX tracks the S&amp;P 500 index which consists of 500 largest companies in the US. You will hear performance of S&amp;P 500 mentioned on the news daily because it's considered the best gauge of market performance.  \n\nITOT tilts heavier toward mid cap and small cap companies. Cap, or capitalization, refers to value of the company. It's calculated by multiplying stock price by number of outstanding shares. Large cap companies have market cap of over $10 billion. Biggest companies in US (Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, for example) have market cap close to $1 trillion. Those are you giant/mega caps. Small cap companies have market cap of less than $2 billion. Mid caps are between $2 billion and $10 billion. Why is it important to hold small and mid caps in your portfolio? Historically, small and mid caps have significantly outperformed large caps. Punch in the numbers and see for yourself: https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio\n\nWhy do small caps outperform large caps? They have more growth potential. Take a large cap company like Walmart and small cap like Burlington. It's much more likely for Burlington to double its sales from $100 to $200 million than Walmart from $100 to $200 billion, for example (I used random sales numbers). Also, small and mid caps are less traded than large caps. Large caps trade millions of shares per day while small and mid caps might trade in thousands. Since they are less popular, they are more likely to be undervalued. Since 1972, small cap value companies outperformed total US market by an average of around 4% per year. \n\nWhat the drawback on small and mid caps? They are much more affected by downturn or slower economy than large caps. Their stock prices are much more volatile. In our case, Burlington will go out of business well before Walmart, for example. \n\nIn a long run, you probably don't want to put all your eggs in FTEC. FSKAX is a total market fund  like ITOT and is far more diversified. But the technology sector has been so hot in the last 10 years. This year alone, FTEC is up close to 20% compared to S&amp;P 500's 12.5% return. Microsoft just hit an all time high two days ago. Apple is up over 3% in the last hour. A huge catalyst for the technology sector will be a trade agreement between US and China. China is a huge market for semiconductors and micro chips. Keep an eye on those news. \n\nThe godfather of indexing and founder of Vanguard, Jack Bogle, recommends a three-fund portfolio (US stocks, international stocks, and bonds). Here is a good read: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio. The consensus on this subreddit is that a person who is 35 years away from retirement shouldn't hold bonds because they are a conservative investment. Regarding international stocks, they have significantly underperformed compared to the US market in the last 10 years. US and European markets seem to move in cycles where one performs better than other for some time and vice versa. Even Vanguard now recommends to allocate a portion of portfolio into international stocks. Reason being is that US market saw a 10 years boom from 2009 to 2018 and is overvalued compared to international markets. I'm 100% in US stocks, but I also didn't have good international index choices when I started contributing to my 401K.

But currently, I can't because my old college won't release my official college transcripts for me to go to a new college until I pay off that 14k... I had a friend tell me about loan consolidation but looking I can't seem to get that because I didn't graduate. So I'm coming here to get some options, what can I do to get that 14k off of my old college's books and onto another loan or something so that I can get the transcripts? I can for sure afford the payments if changed I just want to go back to school while I pay off that debt....   \n\n\nAlso please don't tell me to not go back to school or that it's a bad idea because before I went out of state and paid way to much for school this time I'm going locally and also working a full time job and have little inexpensive bills, like I said I can afford payments and would also be able to keep on top of community college payments for a new degree. i just really need advice on how to get the 14k away from the old college that's all"

I will generalize here from my experience at 6 companies, maybe it's different with these specific companies.  This is how I see it:\n\n* Current employer = low risk, known reward, extra time for hobbies and/or side gigs.\n* Startup = higher risk, higher potential for a big payout, likely more stressful, less personal time.  It is likely to be more demanding of you and give you more autonomy.  You will likely grow more professionally, build more skills, and be more challenged.\n\nIt sounds like the startup's business is software, so they view engineers as an asset instead of a liability.  The airline views you as a necessary expense they cannot do without, not as a revenue generator.  I personally find working at software businesses much better and more fulfilling than other companies.\n\nIf you are looking to grow in your career, challenge yourself, and are fine with a little risk and extra work - I would pick the startup.  It will likely result in more meaningful work/autonomy, gaining more valuable skills, getting paid more at your next job, and potentially large reward.  It could also mean an extra 10+ hours / week that you never get paid for.  I would personally not be too concerned about the risk of the startup.  You are young and should be able to find another job easily.  Just don't burn bridges..\n\nIf you are content with your current role and happy collecting a paycheck with less risk and more free time - I would pick the airline.  Companies like this tend to pigeon hole into a very narrow role, with little autonomy, and will take 8 hours to accomplish as much as a startup will in 1 hour.

You will be able to get a much better deal than from a dealership or used car lot.\n\n* Save enough to buy in cash (you should be able to save this in &lt;3-6 months?). You can usually junk a car for 500-800.  Then you just need to save the difference.

You would probably want to sign up for this 0% card first and get it lined up to ensure you can transfer and not pay high interest on the original card.

What do you mean by \"Investing all of it in a taxable account seems risky and foolish.\"  The type of account doesn't impact the level of risk of the investment.  It may be more optimal to use a tax-advantaged account, but not sure where the perception of risk comes into play.

We are near an all-time high in the stock market and bonds have been on a 30+ year bull run (which is just starting to cool and correct a little).  How would you feel if you deploy this into an 85/15 portfolio and lose 25k in the next year?  If you are planning to use this money for a house in the near future (6 years is pretty \"near\" in finance), I would use a more conservative portfolio.\n3. Why a robo-adviser?

I\u2019d personally recommend Schwab\u2019s Intelligent Portfolio, although there are plenty of other brokerage firms that offer robo to choose from. You answer a risk questionnaire to determine your asset allocation breakdown (and whether you prefer just US vs Global diversification), and Schwab does the rest. They place all of the trades for you and periodically rebalance for you as needed (using % drift as the guideline). There are no trading fees or management/AUM fees. You only pay the underlying fund fees, and because they primarily use their proprietary ETFs, these are very low (~0.15% average).  \n\nThe only drawback to this service\u2014aside from having trading control over your account of course\u2014is that their cash allocation is too high. Usually around 8%, although you can answer the questionnaire in such a way to dwindle that down to 4 or 6% by playing around with the different answers. All that said, and going back to your quote that I started with, 8% sitting in cash while the other 92% is broadly diversified across asset classes/sectors/markets is better than sitting at 100% cash. \n\nDon\u2019t let your hesitation and lack of investing confidence affect your retirement goals more than they already have.

I say this because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re young, being that this is your first 401k. The money that you put aside into this account won\u2019t be touched for ~40 years. Therefore the prudent thing to do is to place 100% of your contributions into an allocation that will provide you with the highest likely returns, regardless of your tolerance for risk.      (An aside: Your risk tolerance WOULD matter for any other account, say a Roth IRA. This would be because while typically Roth IRA funds wouldn\u2019t be touched until 59.5 or older, some circumstances like say, a first time home purchase, qualify for \u201cpremature\u201d withdrawals. Thus you might look at this account with a more moderate risk tolerance, as you could be needing these funds in the next decade or so and might be less comfortable with dramatic swings in your account balance). \n\nNow everyone has their own preferred allocation breakdown in terms of value vs growth and large cap vs mid cap vs small cap, but my 401k is allocated like this:\n\n40% Growth equities \n\n40% Value equities \n\n20% international equities \n\nMy 401k has total growth/value funds, so I\u2019m not able to break it down by large/mid/small, but I\u2019d maybe breakdown each 40% allocation something like 20% Large   10% Mid   10% Small. \n\nAgain, I say this with the assumption that you\u2019re younger and won\u2019t be needing these funds for 40ish years. Keep in mind that there has never been a 30-year period where the stock market has lost money, so it\u2019s more than likely that a 100% equity portfolio will appreciate over the long term (although historical performance is no guarantee of future results). \n\nAt some point, say maybe your 40s or 50s, you will need to rebalance the account towards something more balanced, where market downturns won\u2019t cause such drastic swings in your account balance, but for now you want as much growth potential as possible.

Credit scores mostly focus on a couple things; history of credit, something that you can't do anything about right now but that you can start building on; credit utilization, which means how much you owe on your credit card at the end of every due date, the best way to avoid this negatively affecting your score is to make sure you never spend more on your card than you can afford to pay off with your checking account and make sure you pay your full balance every month. I would suggest saving a bit of money, about 1k, and using it to open a secured credit card. Discover has a great one that you can actually get cash back on it. Start using that, and open up a Self Lender account, they charge like a 10 dollar fee up front, then they open a 2 year CD account for you and put money in it for you as a loan, then you slowly pay off that loan a month at a time over 2  years, then you get all your money back plus the interest that is built up with it at the end of the 2 years, and it shows up as a positive account on your credit report. Just make sure you set it up as something low, like only 25 a month, and never miss a payment. Do that and then 2 years from now you will have a much better credit score and can actually apply for some really good credit cards out that are out there."

Does leaving a balance and paying interest help build your credit score faster? Or are they both the same?

My savings account at Bank of America has terrible rates, I only end up accumulating pennies each month. So my question is, are those savings accounts with higher rates valid? How are they able to offer such high rates without much restrictions?

Very similar situation all around, in fact. My car's trade-in value was listed at around $13.5-14k while I owed about $10k on it. I went for a 2012 Chevy Volt listed at $10.5k because they're priced quite low thanks to the tax credits the first buyers got and the fact that it would essentially eliminate my gas costs in exchange for like $10 of electricity each month, got them down to $9.5k and $13k for my trade-in. Out the door cost on the car ended up being about $9900, minus the $3k equity I had on the trade and my loan is now about $7k instead. My payments are down to $165/month, insurance is down to $90/month, and my gas costs are essentially nonexistent now since all my daily driving is within the battery range.

You'll likely save more than enough from having lower payments on a 6 or 7 year old used car to fix anything that might go wrong, but chances are you'll come out way ahead. And if you're really that worried about it, if you buy a used car from a dealership of that manufacturer you can typically get a warranty added on at the time of purchase. You could probably get a 3 year/50k mile warranty for something like $1,000 added on. I just did literally that last week. Bought a 2012 Volt with 77k miles on it for $9500, along with an extra $600 added for a 3 year/25k mile warranty. I had about $3k down on it, walked away with payments of about $170/month. You could lease a baseline Jetta for around $200/month and then give it back in a few years, or get a used car for less money and own it at the end.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that in 99% of situations, it makes much more sense to buy used, especially when you're only making $15/hr. Believe me, I know exactly what it's like, I currently make $16/hr and am paying both a mortage and a car payment. I'm guessing you don't pay much for bills right now, right? Take this opportunity to actually buy a car. Later on, you'll be thankful to have a car you actually own outright.

It would be better to rent cheaper and join a gym. As far as downtown walking distance is concerned: Spend a few weeks down there in a hotel before deciding where to live. You will find, unlike college, every night isn't a party night. Friday nights and weekends will be an Uber away on those days. Look at it this way: Even if the downtown area *is* party central, would you want to come home from work tired and in need of sleep and have to put up with the ruckus?\n\nListen to your parents. They are footing some bills; you're moving away from them by thousands of miles. At least allow them the idea that they are looking after you from afar. You worked your ass off...I'm sure that work ethic was learned somewhere.\n\nLive a little, but always keep in mind: Rent is throwing money away. you don't need to live in a shack in the swamp (unless that's your kink), but dreaming of lounging by the pool after work grows old fast. As does the gym with bare bones equipment. The lounge? Be prepared to deal with the apartment lounge lizards. The apartment has *shared* amenities...and not everyone always plays nice. It's not like owning your own pool, in your own backyard, with your own BBQ that some jackass didn't forget to clean."

            "text": "One way to get started in real estate is to buy a house, perhaps a double or duplex where you rent out one side and live in the other.  If you look around you may find a house that has \"Mother-in-law\" quarters or even a smaller house on the same lot.  These are not usually attractive to most \"regular\" home buyers, so can be bought for less than you may think, then rent out the space to help pay for the mortgage.\n\nRenting a bedroom in your personal space can be a challenge, and a friend can work but also may be the best way to destroy that friendship.  You may be reluctant to throw them out if they don't pay rent or don't follow the rules, more than paying the mortgage you have to protect the investment you made buying the house.\n\nBeing a landlord can be tough and you will want to have a signed lease that spells out what the tenant (friend or not) is to do and what the consequences are.  Lease templates are widely available online that you can customize.  For someone you don't know a background check can also be ordered online for a modest fee, do this to be sure you know who you are dealing with!\n\nLooking ahead, when all is said and done, and provided you manage this well, you can end up with a good part of the mortgage (if not all!) being paid by the renter and can save up to buy your next and nicer home and may even keep the house to rent out for income.  Over time as the rental house gets paid down and appreciates in value, you may find you can sell it for a nice chunk of cash.\n\nI've successfully done this and there are others on here who likely have as well, so don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.   If this is your first house it can be a bit scary, but once you've bought and sold 8 or 10 properties you will be very comfortable with the process.  Best of luck!"

I\u2019m a therapist as well and I\u2019m assuming from your post that you\u2019re in the licensing stage where you have to be billing under someone else, yes? At least for where I live this is a VERY unorthodox way of paying counselors. Most practices either operate with a shared overhead pay-in or a straight fee split. Usually for APCs or whatever your state calls the associates license it is a fee split and I would encourage you to evaluate what you \u201cget\u201d for your split. For example, 50/50 split on fees is not great where I live BUT when I was right out of school the practice I worked at got me FULL quickly with business, did all the marketing, intake, and paid all the systems. \n\nIf I were you I would pull up your total number of sessions and see what you\u2019re making on average per session month to month. I would anticipate if you\u2019re doing your own intake and marketing you\u2019d want a split of at least 70% but you may be comfortable with lower for a good referral network. I would personally seek to clarify the pay structure to make it cleaner and more transparent. It seems intentionally messy, compared to the way the field is mostly structured.\n\nAlso- are you a W2 or 1099? That also could be affecting how things show up on your paystub"

Obviously we have some time before the little one will be doing chores seeing as she is currently in utero but since finances is a major nerdy conversation in our house and I am a behavioral therapist, it comes up in our greater philosophies on parenting. \n\nBasically, we are planning to have basic chores that are considered part of \u201cbeing in the family\u201d these will change based on kiddos age but likely will have some variation of helping with dinner clean up/dishes, keeping room clean, making bed (??? Maybe I will have to confront some hypocrisy here first), caring for pets, etc... these things don\u2019t come with incentives but may come with negative reinforcements or punishments if avoided.\n\nAside from that, there will be a whole host of other ways our kids can earn money/commissions/allowances. Yard work, home projects, extra assistance, vacuuming the car, washing dog etc... at my husbands house growing up his dad would post weekly or monthly projects with prices and the kids could claim them in exchange for the price. These are optional, but no money will likely flow to our kids without exchanging it for work of some kind. There won\u2019t be any shaming for these things if they opt out, but there also won\u2019t be any money.\n\nLast- we are planning to have some sort of \u201cinvestment withdrawal\u201d situation. Still working out what this might look like, but loosely wanting our kids to be required to save 10% or so of any and all income (possibly including birthday/gift money?) off the top into an UTMA. Also playing around with the idea of incentivizing giving and charity work. \n\nNot sure if this was helpful - currently in pregnancy-induced insomnia posting and not interested in proofing."

I got it years ago when my cat had a urinary blockage that cost $1400 and I was 22 and broke and I felt like the worst person that I was debating not being able to save him. I scrounged together the cash and decided to start budgeting the $20ish a month for his insurance. Since then I have added two dogs and they\u2019re each between 30-40/month.\n\n3 years ago the same cat broke his leg. He had a $3500 surgery to repair it and I paid a $200 deductible. Then, two week into healing the little asshole bent the plate they put in his leg and they had to do another $3500 surgery to remove his leg. For that one I paid $0 since it was part of the same claim. All in all, the situation was super stressful but would have been TERRIBLE if it also came with trying to budget a $7k bill for a surgery that would end up giving our car a totally wonderful, long life thereafter. He does great as a tripod now. \n\nSo now, I honestly hope it ends up becoming a stupid reason to spend money for us one day but I\u2019m certainly glad we have it. If you can self insure through $4-10k in vet bills then it is not worth it. But if you can\u2019t, it sure is nice to know you can base your pets medical decisions on whether the treatment will save them/help them/improve their quality of life - not how much it will cost"

I did scrounge up the money, but since then I\u2019ve personally invested in pet insurance since I knew I wasn\u2019t financially able to support the crisis times.

You\u2019re likely going to spend $60 or so on food a month for a lab, flea and heart worm meds around about $150 for a 6 month supply, so that\u2019s roughly $25 a month, and then annual vet visit is around $150-200 or so depending on what shots they need etc... not to mention the other life stuff that may pop up to eat up your residual $450 (flat tires, oil changes etc...)\n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t do it - just think it all through."

Save up, pay off your debts fully, and then consider moving out."

It can be a hassle, but it's worth it for the extra cash.\n\nAs far as paying off debt vs buying a car, we'd need to know your income, expenses, savings, interest rate and balance on the CC debt, and the price of the car your looking at to get a rough idea of your situation. That said, if you have disposable income monthly, why aren't you using that to further pay down the CC debt right now?"

Financial independence and security are massively important to me and occasionally meeting my own expectations can feel pretty overwhelming. I'm 28, so not all that much older than you.\n\nSo, here's how I've personally handled it:\n\n1. Work out a monthly budget for the things you absolutely have to pay for (rent, utilities, student loans, train fare, etc). \n2. Consciously think about extraneous purchases. Do you really need a third pair of sneakers, or a vehicle upgrade, or new towels? Keep frivolous spending to a minimum, but don't be so frugal you don't enjoy your life. I keep a list of items I want and periodically review it. If an item is on the list for a few months, I have the money, and I still want it, then I buy it. This habit has helped me cut back on impulse purchases significantly.\n3. Set up automatic transfers to a savings account and a retirement account from each paycheck. It's easier not to spend it if you never even see it in your main account. \n4. Set small goals, intermediate goals, and long terms goals. For me this was paying off my car loan, having 6 months of emergency funding in a savings account, and buying a home. Once you reach them, set new goals. Checking goals off a list helps me see the progress and de-stress about everything a bit. \n5. Learn about investing. Knowledge is power. Read books, ask friends in finance, ask family about their financial habits. Don't avoid investing because it makes you nervous, but also don't go into it blindly.\n6. Review your budget annually or anytime there's a big change (moving, raise, loan paid off, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons can be dangerous, but I feel pretty confident saying you're doing better than many people your age. The number of people I know who are in their 20's and even 30's who don't save, don't plan, and don't seem to care at all is astounding. Financial planning and real \"adulthood\" can hit you like a ton of bricks in your early 20's. You'll adjust to it."

The exchange rate might not be the best and there can be some fees depending on your bank, but they can be convenient and they might give you a little more peace of mind than travelling with a large sum of cash.\n\nAlternatively, ask your wedding planner if any of the merchants would be willing to accept a digital payment. Paypal, zelle, venmo, etc. It doesn't hurt to ask."

For a 30 year, I'd expect somewhere between 4 and 4.75. Shop around, the rates really can change a good bit between lenders. Make sure you also look at the fine print and are really comparing apples to apples."
