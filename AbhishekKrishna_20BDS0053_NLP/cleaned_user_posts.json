    "post_text": "No Rent to own virtually doesnt exist anyway and even if it did it would be just a different way to separate you from your hardearned money My response to you has nothing to do with what a bank will approve you for When my wife and I were searching for our first home we made k and paid mo in debts car student loans When we started going through preapproval processes the first bank we spoke to started talking about preapproving us for There is absolutely positively no way that we could afford without putting every free penny we own into a damn house but the bank doesnt care about our ability to do things outside of debt service The bank only cares that we will literally be capable of servicing the debt You can go out and find a bank that will preapprove you for a home but that doesnt mean that you should You know nothing about your husbands exwifes boyfriends financial situation and you should absolutely not be thinking about that person when considering your own financial future When I was a kid I had a friend whose family was pretty much like mine middleclass homeowners living in a lowcost city but in a suburban area of the city When we were in his parents moved them to a McMansion in the suburbs I didnt really think too much about the actual finances involved there but I can tell you that the house his parents sold was worth around k and the one they moved into was probably worth around k I was so surprised by how rich he waswe drifted apart as kids do especially when they go to different schools but I came to find out that his parents moved into an apartment in Why Because they were able to afford their huge house by taking an adjustable rate mortgage at ish interest for the first five years after which point the rate adjusted to ish Their mortgage payment increased by a month and they couldnt refinance into another ARM or a lower fixedrate mortgage they couldnt sell their house because they had taken out a second mortgage to finance other parts of their lives and because the house was only worth k when their rate adjusted so the bank foreclosed on their home and they were left with basically nothing Separately I have a different friend whose parents own a home very much like mine growing up a little bigger and in a nicer area but In high school we were very close and though I knew his family had a decent amount of money they came off as very downtoearth Since weve graduated high school weve stayed close His family is just the same as always but theyve made a fewpurchases First they bought a townhome downtown for their midtwentysomething daughter to live in The townhome cost about k in when they bought it and they eventually sold it to their daughter at a substantial discount after she established herself as a working professional The next year they were at a beach resort one state over when they saw a charming house in a highlydesirable area with a dock They bought that house too with cash I had had no idea that they were so fabulously wealthy because they did not show off they drove their cars til they died they never had cable TV etc I tell these two stories to drive home the point that peoples finances are not as they seem Your husbands exwifes boyfriend could be up to his ears in debt house poor with the mortgage and paying nosebleedlevel interest rates on thousands of dollars on his credit cards he could from a wealthy family and have a trust fund that paid for the house he could also have gotten a tremendous price on the home You just dont know What you do know is that you yourself are not currently prepared for the financial burdens of homeownership None of this is to mention the fact that you want to have a baby of your own soon As a firsttimedad of a nearlyoneyearold let me just tell you that kids are expensive In the first months of my babys life we have spent on the baby herself on medical care having the baby and taking her to the doctor since then on child care and to furnish the nursery this is obviously one you can really cut down on but still All told our baby has cost us more than in her first year on this earth We were prepared for this financially because I do pretty well and my wife got shortterm disability through her work which paid of weeks of maternity leave If youre going to have a baby and if youre the sole reliable earner in the household youre going to need to figure out how to pay for everything you currently have going on plus additional costs in the first few months of a babys life all while you are getting at best a fraction of your current paycheck It is challenging enough when youre renting where most of your costs are fixed Its a bigger challenge when youre juggling all of that in a home that you also need to pay to maintain Our washing machine broke the week after our daughter was born Our choices to deal were a pay several hundred dollars to replace it or b try to manage by lugging ourselves to a laundromat multiple times a week We chose the former and we wound up spending around after all was said and done From the sounds of it a random added expense would be a substantial setback for you right now If thats the case then imagine that kind of setback when your family has lower cash flow due to maternity leave higher fixed expenses due to a fourth member of your family and a depleted savings due to a home purchase Based on the information you provided you are looking for reasons to go down a path that will provide you with shortterm gratification showing that you too can buy a home if somebody whose financial situation is potentially worse than yours can while injecting longterm risk about your familys financial solvency I implore you do not do this"

    "post_text": "Personally Ive heavily prioritized retirement over saving to buy a house My justification is a bit nonstandard so dont take it as gospel gtOne of the primary arguments for having a house that people have used on me is having now home payment when you retire A relatively ty working career for out of undergraduate will be about years ages Go with me here it makes the numbers clean Given that a normal mortgage is years that means having a paid off house at the end of a ty working career leaves years of no mortgage payments gt gtUnder the limits people under can contribute k to a k discounting employer match and k to an IRA not counting aftertax or backdoor conversions and over there are allowed catchup payments of k and k respectively So under the total max contribution is k and over its k gt gtIn short if you max out retirement savings from and then buy a house the k contributed over years of maxing out retirement contributions and saving for a downpayment at a lower rate will be worth mil after years of average growth even if you never contribute another dime and hadnt vested it in anything in the years of contributions Additionally youll have the equity and wealth generation from the house value accrual as well with the last mortgage payment happening at and thus avoiding housing payments in retirement gt gt If you go the other way and buy a house up front youll have years at the end to max out contributions totalling k and only one year of it will have even years of growth which wont even double that years contribution the total is more like total growth ballpark for kish While the house wouldve had longer to grow in value thats illiquid wealth that is difficult to realize gt gtTLDR taking longer to save for a home downpayment and piling into retirement savings early can result in having mil more in liquid assets than buying a house early I know thats simplistic and misses a lot of things it doesnt account for retirement contributions made while making mortgage payments in either scenario it doesnt account for the fact that the house someone would move into at is generally a starter home and they likely wont stay in it for all years pushing the mortgagepayoff date back when they sizeup it doesnt account for the costs of upkeep on a home nor renovation it doesnt account for shorterterm mortgages or later retirement dates or any strategies involving selling a notpaidoff house to downsize into a smallercheaper one with no mortgage partway through this year period What it does is show that its largely better to work on saving for retirement faster than for a mortgage downpayment because the growth potential for retirement savings is much better served by earlyentry and duration of investment Catchup contributions do not actually make up for lost time It also heavily reflects my personal preference for the flexibility of liquid assets at retirement Local real estate markets can cycle up and down fairly widely even if the national one doesnt and I can go on Redfin right now and find at least a dozen houses in my and neighboring counties built years ago that are listed barely above the cost of land for any number of reasons essentially worthless Real estate is not a zeroeffort investment treating a house I live in as a bank account is not something that with So to answer your question more directly How do I juggle saving for a house and for retirement gtIm a yo single male no kids college degree Average for my county gt gtIm maxing out my taxadvantaged retirement funds To the point of pulling the years Roth IRA contribution out of my emergency fund since it constitutes less than mos expenses and keeps me within the mo guideline for a January lumpsum contribution k is levelled to buyin roughly equally throughout the year gt gtnote This is where I diverge from the Prime Directive the most PD says to contribute of to retirement Im overshooting that by maxing out Also pulling out of emergency savings isnt great I justify it because doing so still leaves me within the range but thats not true for budgets below kmo gt gtAfter that my paycheck is directdeposited in two accounts the one I pay bills out of gets a set amount for every paycheck so that my budget never inflates everything beyond that goes into highyield savings to catch bonuses pay raises and taxwithholding adjustments gt gtThis gets a bit messy Ive estimated the size of mortgage Im willing to handle and approximated a budget for that So my emergency savings limit is actually mo expenses at that level not my current one That way once I start paying a mortgage my emergency fund will still be appropriatelysized to my expenses Once I hit that savings level backfilling after my IRAcontribution withdrawal my monthly cash savings start moving into my downpayment fund gt gtThis means that Im really only contributing to my downpayment fund mosyr Current estimate is Im yrs from a downpayment closing costs I could get there faster if I did things differently I dont want to Thats my plan YMMV Feel free to tell me why its dumb"
